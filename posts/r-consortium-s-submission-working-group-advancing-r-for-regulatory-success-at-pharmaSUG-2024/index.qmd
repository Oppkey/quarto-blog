The R Submission Working Group is making significant strides in promoting the use 
of R for regulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical industry. At 
[PharmaSUG 2024](https://www.pharmasug.org/2024-proceedings.html), held from 
May 19-22 in Baltimore, MD, the group’s impact was evident through various 
insightful presentations and discussions.

One highlight was Ben Straub’s presentation, “[Piloting into the Future: 
Publicly available R-based Submissions to the FDA,](https://www.pharmasug.org/proceedings/2024/SS/PharmaSUG-2024-SS-344.pdf)” 
which showcased the growing adoption of R in both industry and regulatory settings. 
Straub emphasized the vibrant R community and its diverse packages that enhance 
statistical analysis and data visualization, highlighting R’s role in facilitating 
efficient and transparent FDA submissions.

Additionally, André Veríssimo and Ismael Rodriguez’s presentation, 
“[Automating SDTM Using R: A Practical Guide,](https://www.pharmasug.org/proceedings/2024/SS/PharmaSUG-2024-SS-376.pdf)” 
demonstrated the advantages of using R for automating the creation of Study Data Tabulation 
Model (SDTM) datasets. They provided a detailed guide on implementing automation techniques 
and sharing best practices and real-world applications to improve data management workflows 
with R.

These presentations underscored the R Submission Working Group’s contributions to 
advancing the use of R in regulatory processes promoting greater efficiency, 
reproducibility, and transparency in pharmaceutical data management.
