### Is the R Consortium committed to R as an open-source project?


Definitely! The R Consortium’s explicit mission is to “advance the worldwide promotion of and support for the R open source language”, and all of its activities are in support of the Open Source R Project. It will support and promote the use of Open Source R in all contents, including in commercial and business settings.


As defined in its ~~[charter](https://www.r-consortium.org/isc-charter.r-consortium.org)~~, the projects of the Infrastructure Steering Committee will focus on support of the user base, support of developers, and general advancement of Open Source R. In particular, a commercial fork of R isn’t compatible with that mission, and won’t be a project of the R Consortium.

### How are R Consortium projects selected and managed?


The technical projects undertaken by the R Consortium in support of the R Project and the R Community are overseen by the [Infrastructure Steering Committee](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects). The ~~[charter of the Infrastructure Steering Committee](https://www.r-consortium.org/isc-charter.r-consortium.org)~~ (ISC) describes its mission, which is to advance the worldwide promotion of and support for R, and to develop projects, technical and infrastructure collaboration initiatives, support specific initiatives related to R. The membership of the ISC is drawn from the Platinum Members, Silver Members and the R Foundation. As the ISC appoints top-level projects, it is expected that those project leads will join the ISC as voting members.

### Why the focus on organizations rather than individuals?


Hundreds of companies around the world have invested heavily in R, by building systems on the R platform and by hiring thousands of R developers. The R Consortium provides a means for those companies to invest in the R Project directly, to collaborate on projects of mutual interest to support the R Community as a whole, and to support the ongoing success of the R Project.

### What is the relationship between the R Consortium and the Linux Foundation?


The R Consortium is an independent organization, but as [Collaborative Project of the Linux Foundation](http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org/?__hstc=98577409.44d7f16716270a3b9b81de6d864e02dc.1720553161514.1720553161514.1720553161514.1&__hssc=98577409.10.1720553161514&__hsfp=1019891917), the Linux Foundation provides operational support and guidance.

### What is the relationship between the R Consortium and the R Foundation?


The [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) is the leader of the R Project and the custodian of the R source code and copyright. The R Foundation determines the definition and evolution of the R language.


The R Consortium, as an independent entity, exists to support the R Community and the R Project as a whole — and that includes providing support to the R Foundation. That’s why the R Foundation has a guaranteed seat on the Board and the Infrastructure Steering Committee, to represent the interests of the R Foundation and to propose projects to support R itself.

### Why an R Consortium?
