    "text": "The R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee periodically solicits proposals from the worldwide R community for projects which will help advance the state of the R ecosystem. Developers and organizations may apply to participate in the program and receive funding to help further a project or initiative.\nGrants funded in this group:\n\nAn External R Sampling Profiler\nCVXR\nFlipbooks\nR Package Risk Assessment Application\nRcppDeepState, a simple way to fuzz test compiled code in R packages\nSymbolic mathematics in R with SymPy\nTidy spatial networks in R\nd3po: R package for easy interactive D3 visualization with Shiny\nwebchem: accessing chemical information from the web\n\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$8,500\nProposed by:\nAaron Jacobs\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/atheriel/xrprof\nSummary:\nMany R users will be familiar with using the built-in sampling profiler ‘Rprof()’ to generate data on what their code is doing, and there are several excellent tools to facilitate understanding these samples (or serve as a front-end), including the ‘profvis’ package. However, the reach of these tools is limited: the profiler is “internal”, in the sense that it must be manually switched on to work, either during interactive work (for example, to profile an individual function), or perhaps by modifying the script to include ‘Rprof()’ calls before running it again. It cannot be used to understand R code that is already running, a capability that has proven extremely useful for diagnosing and fixing performance issues (or other bugs) in production environments.\nSeveral existing programming languages have one or more “external” profilers available, which can attach to a running process and read its memory contents to understand what is currently happening. This project aims to build such a tool for R.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$9,500\nProposed by:\nDavid W Kang\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/cvxgrp/CVXR\nSummary:\nOptimization is at the core of statistical estimation and machine learning methodology. There are a number of R packages such as optimx, nloptr, ROI which either implement solvers for a wide variety of problems, or provide an interface to other solvers. The R package CVXR takes a different approach, implementing a Domain Specific Language (Fu, Narasimhan, and Boyd 2019) for formulating and solving convex optimization problems, just as cvxpy does for python. As shown in a number of examples on the CVXR website, the applications range from finance, machine learning, and to theoretical and applied statistics. Using a disciplined convex programming (DCP) approach, CVXR acts as a great tool for both prototyping and developing new methodologies as well as for quick, high-level, formulation and solution of statistical and machine learning problems.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$6,699\nProposed by:\nEvangeline Reynolds\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr\nSummary:\nJust as classic flip books allow their readers to observe changes in a scene, coding Flipbooks allow readers to progressively track the changes of code and its output by “flipping” through their digital pages. Flipbooks are useful tools for communicating and teaching because they break down code for incremental, stepwise presentation so that audiences can easily understand each step. Flipbook-building tools automate the deconstruction and reconstruction of coding pipelines which means that building a Flipbook from existing code poses little additional burden to creators. The next stage for this project is to develop the current Flipbook-building tools into a reliable and easy-to-use R package (development is ongoing at https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr) and also to provide educational guidance for creating Flipbooks.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$16,800\nProposed by:\nAndrew Nicholls\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.pharmar.org/\nSummary:\nThe R Validation Hub is an active R Consortium Working Group. It is a cross-industry initiative whose mission is to enable the use of R by the Bio-Pharmaceutical Industry in a regulatory setting, where the output may be used in submissions to regulatory agencies. This project sits within phase 2 of the R Validation Hub’s road map. During this phase the group will develop several tools that can be used by those wishing to use R packages within a bio-pharmaceutical regulatory setting. The aim of this specific project is to standardise and simplify the risk assessment of R packages, reducing the burden of package evaluation/testing that would otherwise fall on internal R programming experts. The project will deliver a Shiny application to aid in the assessment and documentation of package risk.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$34,000\nProposed by:\nToby Hocking\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/akhikolla/RcppDeepState\nSummary:\nAbstract: Fuzzers are computer programs that send other programs inputs that may fall outside the domain of expected values, thus revealing subtle bugs. DeepState is a testing framework that allows easy testing of C/C++ programs with sophisticated fuzzers, and supports multiple back-ends for testing. DeepState has been used to test critical C++ software, including Google’s leveldb. R has some simple random testers, but no coverage-driven fuzzers that learn to produce problematic inputs. We propose to create the R packages RcppDeepState and RcppDeepStateTools which will provide easy-to-use functions for using DeepState with R packages that use C/C++ code via Rcpp. This project will thus provide the first easy-to-use solution for R programmers that want to fuzz test their C/C++ code with existing tools such as AFL, and it will provide a framework for interfacing future coverage-driven fuzzers or symbolic execution tools. We also propose to use these new tools on a wide range of R packages in order to identify bugs in their C/C++ code.\nOne masters student will be recruited to implement this project during Jan-Dec 2020 at the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems at Northern Arizona University. Interested students should apply by emailing a resume/CV along with a cover letter to project supervisors toby.hocking@nau.edu and alex.groce@nau.edu.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$10,000\nProposed by:\nMikkel Meyer Andersen\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/r-cas/caracas/\nSummary:\nR’s ability to do symbolic mathematics is largely restricted to finding derivatives. There are many tasks involving symbolic math that are of interest to R users, e.g. inversion of symbolic matrices, limits and solving non-linear equations. Users must resort to other software for such tasks and many R users (especially outside of academia) do not readily have access to such software.\nThe Python library SymPy is open source, has a stable group of developers and is powerful. As such, R users can just switch to Python and SymPy for symbolic math. However it is often very convenient to stay in the same environment to use familiar syntax and to utilise available libraries (e.g. to generate problems using symbolic math together with the exams package or to first handle symbolic computations and then afterwards move on to a numerical evaluations of the results). We will achieve this by making SymPy functionality available for R users via an R package.\nCurrently only few R packages for doing symbolic mathematics are available: Two of these are Ryacas and rSymPy. Ryacas is built around Yacas, and although Yacas can solve many problems and is extensible, the community is relatively small and Yacas is not as powerful as SymPy for certain routine tasks (e.g. integration and solving equations). rSymPy on the other hand is based on technology that requires much technical work to install and use.\nThe website of the project is:\nhttps://github.com/r-cas/caracas/\nPlease contribute by testing, writing documentation, opening issues, submitting pull requests or something else!\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$9,000\nProposed by:\nLucas van der Meer, Robin Lovelace, Andrea Gilardi, Lorena Abad\nWebsite:\nhttps://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/\nSummary:\nR is currently lacking a generally applicable, modern and easy-to-use way of handling all kinds of spatial networks. “Tidy spatial networks in R” aims to address this issue by developing and publishing the sfnetworks package. The package, and documentation around it, will provide a bridge between network analysis and spatial analysis communities. For this, an sfnetwork class that will work with both tidygraph and sf frameworks and functions. R-users will be encouraged to contribute and engage with the package development during a hackathon organized next to the eRum 2020.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$4,000\nProposed by:\nMauricio Vargas Sepúlveda\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/pachamaltese/d3po\nSummary:\nR already features excellent visualization libraries such as D3 (via the r2d3 package), plotly or highcharter. However, though those enable the creation of great looking visualisations they have very steep learning curves, require understanding of JavaScript or rely on non-free software that might be out of reach for governments and NGOs. Our intention is to solve those problems by releasing d3po. It shall be an intermediate layer between the user and D3 by providing “templates”, enabling high quality interactive visualizations oriented to and designed to be used with Shiny and Rmarkdown, and also proving easy internationalization. Please join us, this needs D3 and R skilled minds!\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$6,000\nProposed by:\nEric Scott, Tamas Stirling\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/ropensci/webchem\nSummary:\nwebchem: accessing chemical information from the web\nA vast amount of chemical information is freely available on the internet. The data are used by millions of professionals around the world, for purposes like pharmaceutical research, chemical process design, or environmental impact assessment, to name a few. webchem is an R project that aims to help these professionals by providing a single point programmable access to all major chemical databases around the world. The project started in 2016 and currently supports more than 10 databases. If you are interested, join us and help us build the tool that biologists and chemists will absolutely love."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A major goal of the R Consortium is to strengthen and improve the infrastructure supporting the R Ecosystem. We seek to accomplish this by funding projects that will improve both technical infrastructure and social infrastructure.\nTechnical Infrastructure projects that have be funded include:\n\nR-hub, a centralized tool for checking R packages\nTesting DBI and improving key open source database backends.\nImprovements in packages such as mapview and sf\nImproving Translations in R\nOngoing infrastructural development for R on Windows and macOS\n\nSocial Infrastructure projects include:\n\nSatRDays, bootstrapping a system for local R conferences.\nData-Driven Discovery and Tracking of R Consortium Activities\n\nThe Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) projects should have a focus on technical infrastructure or involve software development to support social infrastructure. Conferences, training sessions, and user groups will be funded through the RUGS program.\nTo apply for an ISC grant please continue with the instructions below. To seek funding for a conference, training session or user group please apply through the RUGS program page.\n\n\nThe ISC is interested in projects that:\n\nAre likely to have a broad impact on the R community.\nHave a focused scope (a good example is the Simple Features for R project). If you have a larger project, consider breaking it up into smaller chunks (a good example of this done is with the DBI/DBItest project submission, where multiple proposals came in over time to address the various needs).\nHave a low-to-medium risk with a low-to-medium reward. The ISC tends not fund high-risk, high-reward projects.\n\nWhile all projects are considered, the ISC generally does not accept projects that:\n\nImpact only a small part of the R community\nRequest conference, workshop, or meetup sponsorship. For these, you should look at our user group program or connect with the marketing committee for larger events.\nAre very exploratory. These are better to be pursued through the working group program.\n\n\n\n\nPlease provide a 2 to 5 page proposal that describes the problem you want to solve. We expect submissions to include these components:\n\nThe Problem: What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should include a brief summary of existing work, such as R packages that may be relevant. If you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of support from a member of R Core.\nThe Plan: How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?\nThe Team: Who will work on the project? Briefly describe all participants, and the skills they will bring to the project.\nProject Milestones: Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be required for each stage (as payments will be tied to project milestone completion). Each milestone should specify the work to be done and the expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to understand the scope of the project work and assess the likelihood of success.\nHow Can The ISC Help: Please describe how you think the ISC can help.

    "text": "Funded ISC Grants (2021-1)\nThe R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee periodically solicits proposals from the worldwide R community for projects which will help advance the state of the R ecosystem. Developers and organizations may apply to participate in the program and receive funding to help further a project or initiative.\nGrants funded in this group:\n\nAccounting/Auditing Gap-Analysis\nExtendr - Rust extensions for R.\nGoogle Earth Engine with R\nImproving Translations in R\nMinimizing wastage of blood products\nR for Engineering Applications\nSetting up an R-Girls-Schools Network\ndeposits: Deposit Research Data Anywhere\n\n\n\nAccounting/Auditing Gap-Analysis\nFunded:\n$7,000\nProposed by:\nFelix Schildorfer\nSummary:\nThere are more and more accountants and auditors who want to start using R and dig into data science. They usually have particular tasks on hand that they want to complete, facilitate, or automate. While they often have some basic stats skills and may be some coding basics, understanding the R landscape and relating tasks and processes to locate and use relevant R packages and tutorials is an extreme challenge. While other areas like finance or pharmaceuticals already have extensive infrastructure to support R newcomers (Working Groups, Courses, Task Views, etc.) accounting and auditing do not. This becomes an obstacle for such professionals - which find the “coding” part difficult on their own but doing so without any support or knowing the appropriate package becomes a nightmare.\nThis is why R Business put together this project with the aim to gauge the landscape of what functionalities are available for Auditors in the R ecosystem and how the existing functionalities can be mapped to routine accounting/auditing tasks. We will complete a systematic survey of the CRAN-ecosystem for accounting/auditing tasks to establish a mapping and identify gaps. The project will contribute to the development of the R Business ISC working group by attracting interested accounting/auditing professionals, industry bodies and R community members. This will then in turn lead to increased use of R/RStudio, development new application domains for data science, and enhancement of the quality of accounting/auditing services.\n\n\nExtendr - Rust extensions for R.\nFunded:\n$15,000\nProposed by:\nAndy Thomason\nSummary:\nRust extension framework for R.\n\n\nGoogle Earth Engine with R\nFunded:\n$5,500\nProposed by:\nCesar Luis Aybar Camacho\nSummary:\nGoogle Earth Engine (GEE) is the most popular and advanced cloud platform designed for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. Its multi-petabyte data catalog and computation services are just accessed via Python and JavaScript client libraries. In order to facilitate its use within R, six months ago, rgee was released on CRAN using reticulate to wrap the GEE Python API. Although rgee provides a familiar interface and simple integration to other R packages (e.g., sf, raster, dplyr), the lack of tutorials and examples makes it difficult for new users to adopt.\nThe main goal of this project is to leverage the documentation. For this purpose, three main tasks have been proposed: (1) create a new version of rgee with support for shiny and markdown, (2) create rgeeExtra, which extends the functionalities of rgee, and finally write (3) rgeebook, a reference book with best practices and examples of GEE API usage.\n\n\nImproving Translations in R\nFunded:\n$0\nProposed by:\nMichael Chirico\nSummary:\nThis project will provide a better formalization of translation procedures for R to be more sustainable and more scalable. In the process, it will broaden the inclusivity of R by growing the sub-community of R users comfortable producing translations and extending the reach of the R project to more non-English audiences.\n\n\nMinimizing wastage of blood products\nFunded:\n$11,200\nProposed by:\nBalasubramanian Narasimhan\nSummary:\nGuan et al. 2017 (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 114 (43): 11368–73) used two years worth of data to formulate and solve an optimization problem to predict platelet usage and minimize waste. Two open-source R packages were developed for this purpose:\n- Platelet Inventory Prediction or pip (https://github.com/bnaras/pip) a package that is the core ML prediction engine that uses a given set of features described in the above publication\n- Stanford Blood Center Platelet Inventory Prediction or SBCpip (https://github.com/bnaras/SBCpip) that was customized to the data workflow at SHC. SBCpip was meant to be site specific.\nThere have been a number of requests from sites wishing to deploy the software locally. The current project will generalize the model, generalize it to address more blood products with different shelf lives, provide customizations for local use, and create easily deployable solutions.\n\n\nR for Engineering Applications\nFunded:\n$3,000\nProposed by:\nBenaiah Chibuokem Ubah\nSummary:\nR for Engineering Applications is a proposed project with the aim to attract engineers and diversify the use of the R language to the broad engineering domain – electrical, electronic, communications, robotics, etc engineering. The idea is similar to such projects as R in Finance, R in Insurance, BioConductor (R in Bio-informatics), R in Environmental Statistics, etc.\n\n\nSetting up an R-Girls-Schools Network\nFunded:\n$5,000\nProposed by:\nDr. Razia Ghani\nSummary:\nGlobally, women, especially from deprived socio-economic and diverse ethnic backgrounds, are under-represented in data science. A major factor is that data science does not feature in the school curriculum which means that teachers are unaware of the enhancements data science can bring to learning and development in and beyond the school. We propose an ongoing project, called R-Girls-School Network (short name R-Girls) to address this and are keen to link up with others.\nWe are a multi-disciplinary team that includes an educationalist, subject teachers, a data scientist and administrator who will begin to develop and implement a data science curriculum using R in Green Oak Academy – an inner-city school in the UK serving girls from deprived, ethnically diverse backgrounds aged 11-16 years; independently rated as Good with Outstanding for Behaviour and Attitudes.\nSince GOA follows the UK national curriculum, which is used in 10,000+ schools and 160 countries, our work will have a broad appeal. In due course we will develop ready-to-use bite-sized learning materials (10-15 mins) for teachers of core subjects (maths, statistics, science, geography) to use via RStudio cloud. The lessons will be tested with teachers and pupils and then incorporated into the school timetable across all five-year groups (age 11-16 years), culminating in an R-Data Story project and in due course, an annual R-Girls virtual conference open to any girl and girls’ school in the world.\nR-GS will be supported by a website for showcasing the work of pupils and sharing resources.\n\n\ndeposits: Deposit Research Data Anywhere\nFunded:\n$16,000\nProposed by:\nMark Padgham\nSummary:\nPublicly depositing datasets associated with published research is becoming more common, partly due to journals increasingly requiring data sharing, and partly though more general and ongoing cultural changes in relation to data sharing. Yet data sharing is often seen as time consuming, particularly in order to meet the expectations of individual data repositories. While documentation and training can help get users familiar with processes of data sharing, browser-based data and metadata submission workflows can only be so fast, are not easily reproduced, and do not facilitate regular or automated updates of data and metadata. Better programmatic tools can transform data sharing from a mountainous climb into a pit of success.\nThis project will develop a unified interface to many different research data repositories, and which will function along the lines of dplyr through “verbs” that work identically across many “backend” data repositories. The package will initially provide access to a few of the most common data repositories, yet will implement a modular/plugin system to enable users to contribute their own plugins to extend functionality to other repositories. Users will be able to authenticate, prepare data and metadata, and finally to submit, fetch, and browse data."

While the seamless integration of code and text made possible by Sweave, knitr, and rmarkdown was designed for writing reproducible reports and documentation, it has also enabled the creation of teaching materials that combine text, code examples, exercises and solutions. However, while people creating lessons in RMarkdown are familiar with R, they often do not have a background in education or UX design. Therefore, they must not only assemble curriculum, but also find a way to present the content effectively and accessibly to both learners and instructors. As the model of open source development is being adapted to the creation of open educational resources, the difficulty to share materials due to a lack of consistency in their construction hinders the collaborative development of these resources.\nThis project will develop an R package that will facilitate the development of consistent teaching resources. It will encourage the use of tools and lesson structure that support and improve learning. By providing the technical framework for developing quality teaching materials, we seek to encourage collaborative lesson development by letting authors focus on the content rather than the formatting, while providing a more consistent experience for the learners.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$26,500\nProposed by:\nKirill Müller\nWebsite:\nhttps://dbi.r-dbi.org/\nSummary:\nDBI, R’s database interface, is a set of methods declared in the DBI R package. Communication with the database is implemented by DBI backends, packages that import DBI and implement its methods. A common interface is helpful for both users and backend implementers.\nThe “Maintaining DBI” is a follow-up project to two previous projects supported by the R Consortium, and is mostly about providing ongoing maintenance and support for DBI, the DBItest test suite, and the three backends to open-source databases (RSQLite, RMariaDB and RPostgres) that have been implemented as part of the previous projects.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$62,400\nProposed by:\nJeroen Ooms\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/r-hub/homebrew-cran#how-to-use\nSummary:\nThe majority of R users rely on precompiled installers and binary packages for Windows and MacOS that are made available through CRAN. This project seeks to improve and maintain tools for providing such binaries, and relieve some of the dependence on CRAN maintainers and R-core members for doing so. On Windows we will upgrade the Rtools compiler toolchain, and provide up-to-date Windows builds for the many external C/C++ libraries used by CRAN packages. For MacOS we will expand the r-hub “homebrew-cran” tap with formulas that are needed by CRAN packages but not available from upstream homebrew-core. Eventually we want to lay the foundation for a reproducible build system that is low maintenance, automated as much as possible, and which could be used by CRAN and other R package repositories.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$4,000\nProposed by:\nLyn Taylor (on behalf of PSI AIMS SIG)\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.pharmar.org/\nSummary:\nThe documentation available for R packages currently widely varies. The Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (PSI) Application and Implementation of Methodologies in Statistics (AIMS) Special Interest Group (SIG) will collaborate with the R-Consortium and representatives from pharmaceutical companies on the setting up of an online repository /web portal, where validation which is of regulatory standard for R packages can be submitted and stored for free use.

It will create a working group where R users working with census data can cooperate under the guidance of the Census Bureau.

Indeed, R-hub is currently a successful and very valuable project, but it is not documented thoroughly, which hinders its wider adoption by package developers. This project shall answer this concern by three main actions: improving R-hub documentation, making R-hub better known in the community and making the R-hub web site more attractive to, and easier to use by, R developers and users via the ingestion of METACRAN services and the creation of a R-hub blog.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$5,250\nProposed by:\nBenaiah Chibuokem Ubah\nWebsite:\nhttps://benubah.github.io/r-community-explorer/rugs.html\nSummary:\nThis project proposes an infrastructure that provides a data-driven approach to render the yearly activities of the R Consortium, by deploying web pages for discovering and tracking ISC Funded Projects, RUGS and Marketing activities. These pages are planned to appear like dashboards summarizing activities in interactive tables and charts, presenting several views, trends and insights to what R Consortium has achieved over time. The project hopes that presenting these achievements in a data-driven manner to the R community, the data science community and prospective R Consortium members will promote greater transparency, productivity and community inclusiveness around R Consortium activities.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$50,000\nProposed by:\nDianne Cook\nWebsite:\nhttps://rjpilot.netlify.app/\nSummary:\nThis project supports the operation of the R Journal. There are two aspects, one is to fund an editorial assistant to send reminders about reviews, and assist with typesetting and copyediting issues. The second part is to explore updating the technical operations of the journal production.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$6,000\nProposed by:\nColin Fay\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/ThinkR-open/isc-proposal-licence/ and https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/intro.html#getting-a-more-global-idea and https://github.com/ThinkR-open/isc-proposal-licence/blob/master/proposal_licence.md\nSummary:\nLicensing is a vital part of Open Source. It provides guidelines for interacting with a program, and for making code accessible and reusable (or not). It provides a way to make code open source, in a way one wants to share it, protecting how it will be used and reused. Licensing is also challenging and complex: there are a lot of available licenses, and the choice is influenced by how you import and interact with elements from other packages and/or programs.\nWith this project, we propose to explore and document the current state of open source licenses in R, and to decipher compatibility and incompatibly elements inside these licenses, to help developers chose the best suited licence for their project.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$25,000\nProposed by:\nClaus Wilke\nWebsite:\nhttps://wilkelab.org/gridtext/\nSummary:\nText is a key component of any data visualization. We need to label axes and legends, we need to annotate or highlight specific data points, and we need to provide plot titles and captions. The R graphics package ggplot2 provides numerous features to customize the labeling and annotation of plots, but ultimately it is limited by the current capabilities of the underlying graphics libary it uses, grid. Grid can draw simple text strings or mathematical expressions (via plotmath) in different colors, sizes, and fonts. However, it lacks functionality for changing formatting within a string (e.g., draw a single word in italics or in a different color), and it also cannot draw text boxes, where the text is enclosed in a box with defined margins, padding, or background color. This project will support the development of a new package, gridtext, that will alleviate these text formatting limitations. The project will also support efforts to make these new capabilities available from within ggplot2.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$20,000\nProposed by:\nEmmanuel Blondel\nWebsite:\nSummary:\nThe project aims to strengthen the role of R in support of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) management, through major enhancements of the geometa R package which offers tools for reading and writing ISO/OGC geographic metadata, including ISO 19115, 19110, and 19119 through the ISO 19139 XML format. This also extends to the Geographic Markup Language (GML - ISO 19136) used for describing geographic data.

Indeed, R-hub is currently a successful and very valuable project, but it is not documented thoroughly, which hinders its wider adoption by package developers. This project shall answer this concern by three main actions: improving R-hub documentation, making R-hub better known in the community and making the R-hub web site more attractive to, and easier to use by, R developers and users via the ingestion of METACRAN services and the creation of a R-hub blog.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$5,250\nProposed by:\nBenaiah Chibuokem Ubah\nWebsite:\nhttps://benubah.github.io/r-community-explorer/rugs.html\nSummary:\nThis project proposes an infrastructure that provides a data-driven approach to render the yearly activities of the R Consortium, by deploying web pages for discovering and tracking ISC Funded Projects, RUGS and Marketing activities. These pages are planned to appear like dashboards summarizing activities in interactive tables and charts, presenting several views, trends and insights to what R Consortium has achieved over time. The project hopes that presenting these achievements in a data-driven manner to the R community, the data science community and prospective R Consortium members will promote greater transparency, productivity and community inclusiveness around R Consortium activities.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$50,000\nProposed by:\nDianne Cook\nWebsite:\nhttps://rjpilot.netlify.app/\nSummary:\nThis project supports the operation of the R Journal. There are two aspects, one is to fund an editorial assistant to send reminders about reviews, and assist with typesetting and copyediting issues. The second part is to explore updating the technical operations of the journal production.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$6,000\nProposed by:\nColin Fay\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/ThinkR-open/isc-proposal-licence/ and https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/intro.html#getting-a-more-global-idea and https://github.com/ThinkR-open/isc-proposal-licence/blob/master/proposal_licence.md\nSummary:\nLicensing is a vital part of Open Source. It provides guidelines for interacting with a program, and for making code accessible and reusable (or not). It provides a way to make code open source, in a way one wants to share it, protecting how it will be used and reused. Licensing is also challenging and complex: there are a lot of available licenses, and the choice is influenced by how you import and interact with elements from other packages and/or programs.\nWith this project, we propose to explore and document the current state of open source licenses in R, and to decipher compatibility and incompatibly elements inside these licenses, to help developers chose the best suited licence for their project.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$25,000\nProposed by:\nClaus Wilke\nWebsite:\nhttps://wilkelab.org/gridtext/\nSummary:\nText is a key component of any data visualization. We need to label axes and legends, we need to annotate or highlight specific data points, and we need to provide plot titles and captions. The R graphics package ggplot2 provides numerous features to customize the labeling and annotation of plots, but ultimately it is limited by the current capabilities of the underlying graphics libary it uses, grid. Grid can draw simple text strings or mathematical expressions (via plotmath) in different colors, sizes, and fonts. However, it lacks functionality for changing formatting within a string (e.g., draw a single word in italics or in a different color), and it also cannot draw text boxes, where the text is enclosed in a box with defined margins, padding, or background color. This project will support the development of a new package, gridtext, that will alleviate these text formatting limitations. The project will also support efforts to make these new capabilities available from within ggplot2.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$20,000\nProposed by:\nEmmanuel Blondel\nWebsite:\nSummary:\nThe project aims to strengthen the role of R in support of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) management, through major enhancements of the geometa R package which offers tools for reading and writing ISO/OGC geographic metadata, including ISO 19115, 19110, and 19119 through the ISO 19139 XML format. This also extends to the Geographic Markup Language (GML - ISO 19136) used for describing geographic data. The use of geometa in combination with publication tools such as ows4R ( https://cran.r-project.org/package=ows4R ) and geosapi (https://cran.r-project.org/package=geosapi) fosters the use of R software to ease the management and publication of metadata documents and related datasets in web catalogues, and then allows to move forward with a real R implementation of spatial data management plans based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) principles.\nThe workplan includes several activities such as working on the completeness of the ISO 19115 (ISO 19115-1 and 19115-2) data model in geometa, functions to read/write multilingual metadata documents, and an increased metadata validation capability with a validator targeting the EU INSPIRE directive.

Along the same lines, the ‘errors’ package integrates and automatises error propagation and printing for R vectors. A significant fraction of R users, both practitioners and researchers, use R to analyse measurements, and would benefit from a joint processing of quantity values with errors.\nThis project not only aims at orchestrating units and errors in a new data type, but will also extend the existing frameworks (compatibility with base R as well as other frameworks such as the tidyverse) and standardise how to import/export data with units and errors.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$10,000\nProposed by:\nRichard Beare\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/richardbeare/RConsortiumSwig\nSummary:\nThe Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a tool for automatically generating interface code between interpreters, including R, and a C or C++ library. The R module needs to be updated to support modern developments in R and the rest of SWIG. This project aims to make the R module conform to the recommended SWIG standards and thus ensure that there is support for R in the future. We hope that this project will be the first step in allowing SWIG generated R code using reference classes."

This project aims to provide a formal Future API specification and provide a test framework for validating the conformance of existing (e.g. future.batchtools and future.callr) and to-come third-party parallel backends to the Future framework.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$10,000\nProposed by:\nInaki Ucar\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/r-quantities/quantities and https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/08/31/quantities-final.html\nSummary:\nThe ‘units’ package has become the reference for quantity calculus in R, with a wide and welcoming response from the R community. Along the same lines, the ‘errors’ package integrates and automatises error propagation and printing for R vectors. A significant fraction of R users, both practitioners and researchers, use R to analyse measurements, and would benefit from a joint processing of quantity values with errors.\nThis project not only aims at orchestrating units and errors in a new data type, but will also extend the existing frameworks (compatibility with base R as well as other frameworks such as the tidyverse) and standardise how to import/export data with units and errors.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$10,000\nProposed by:\nRichard Beare\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/richardbeare/RConsortiumSwig\nSummary:\nThe Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a tool for automatically generating interface code between interpreters, including R, and a C or C++ library. The R module needs to be updated to support modern developments in R and the rest of SWIG. This project aims to make the R module conform to the recommended SWIG standards and thus ensure that there is support for R in the future. We hope that this project will be the first step in allowing SWIG generated R code using reference classes."

We may combine this information with other information we collect about Users. Below, we provide a brief summary these activities. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy.\nCookies These are small files with a unique identifier that are transferred to your browser through our websites. They allow us to remember Users who are logged in, to understand how Users navigate through and use the Sites, and to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third party sites and applications).\nPixels, web beacons, clear GIFs These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which we track browsing activities. We use these as part of our Training Affiliate Program. We also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.\nAnalytics Tools We may use internal and third-party analytics tools, including Google Analytics. The third-party analytics companies we work with may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online products and services. Their collection and use of information is subject to their own privacy policies.\nPlease note that R Consortium does not respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms intended to allow California residents to opt-out of Internet tracking under California Online Privacy Protection Action (“CalOPPA”).\nTargeted Ads As discussed in our Cookie Policy, we may work with third party advertisers to display more relevant ads on our website and on third party sites; these third parties may display ads to you based on your visit to our Sites and other third party sites. For more information about this and how you can opt out of such ads, please see our Cookie Policy.\n\n\n\nWe have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.\nYou should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing robust passwords that nobody else knows or can easily guess, not using a password for more than one site or service, and keeping your log-ins and passwords private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. You must promptly notify us if you become aware that any information provided by or submitted to our Sites or through our Services is lost, stolen, or used without permission at privacy@linuxfoundation.org.\n\n\n\nYou may opt out or revoke your consent to receive marketing emails from us by using unsubscribe or opt out mechanisms included in our marketing emails or by emailing privacy@linuxfoundation.org.

However, we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses which protect personal data transferred between R Consortium and affiliated entities as well as The Linux Foundation, its managed service provider. In addition, if personal data is transferred to third party service providers located outside the European Union, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements, or using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU by contacting privacy@linuxfoundation.org.\n\n\n\nExcept as specifically indicated within a Site, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16, or knowingly allow such persons to register. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without parental consent, we take steps to delete that information.\n\n\n\nThe Sites may contain links to third party sites or online services. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties, whose information practices are subject to their own policies and procedures, not to this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\nAccess and Amendment. You may contact our privacy coordinator, as set forth below, to access or amend your personal information.\nAdditional Rights. Individuals in the European Economic Area (and other jurisdictions where applicable) have additional rights under applicable law:\n\nto obtain a copy of your personal data together with information about how and on what basis that personal data is processed;\nto rectify inaccurate personal data (including to have incomplete personal data completed);\nto erase your personal data (in limited circumstances, such as where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed);\nto restrict processing of your personal data under certain circumstances;\nto export certain personal data in machine-readable format to a third party (or to you) when we justify our processing on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract with you;\nto withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where that processing is based on your consent);\nto obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal data is transferred to a third country or international organization; and\nto object to our use and processing of your personal information that is conducted on the basis of a legitimate interest or to perform a contract with you. You also have the right to object at any time to any processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including profiling for marketing purposes.\n\nLodging a Complaint. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority for data protection, or privacy regulator.\nSubmitting a Request. To exercise the above rights or contact us with questions or complaints regarding our treatment of your personal data, contact us at privacy@linuxfoundation.org. Please note that we may request proof of identity, and we reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, especially if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We will endeavor to respond to your request within all applicable timeframes.\n\n\n\nCalifornia law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the types of personal information disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email to privacy@linuxfoundation.org.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions about our practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@linuxfoundation.org, or write to us at: R Consortium, 1 Letterman Drive, Building D, Suite D4700, San Francisco, CA 94129.\n\n\n\nThis Policy is current as of the effective date set forth above. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page and/or continue to provide access to a copy of the prior version. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that materially change how we treat your personal information, we will endeavor to provide you with reasonable notice of such changes, such as via prominent notice on our Sites or to your email address of record, and where required by law, we will obtain your consent or give you the opportunity to opt out of such changes."

    "title": "Navigating R’s Impact in Vienna: Insights from the Finance and Pharmaceutical Sectors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium recently spoke with Mario Annau, co-organizer of the Vienna R User Group. During the conversation, he discussed the use of R in the finance and pharmaceutical industries in Vienna. He also shared insights into the latest and upcoming trends in using R in these sectors and tips for organizing successful hybrid meetups with minimal overhead.\nIn September 2022, Mario Annau talked to the R Consortium about the role of the local financial industry in the Robust Vienna R Community. Recently, the R Consortium reached out to Mario for a detailed discussion about the use of R in the finance and pharmaceutical industries in Vienna. Mario shared his insights regarding the latest and upcoming trends in using R in these sectors and tips for organizing successful hybrid meetups with minimal overhead.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI became interested in R during my university studies in computer science. I earned a bachelor’s degree in software engineering and a master’s in intelligent systems or computational intelligence. During my master’s studies, I began using R. I also found out that Kurt Hornik, was at a different university in Vienna and was also using R. Together with other R core developers, he created R with its package repository and many features. Although I am not a trained statistician, I became more involved in statistics and machine learning, which are closely related. I did my master’s thesis with Kurt Hornik.\nDuring my second thesis, I became increasingly involved with R, which led me to explore text mining and sentiment analysis with this language. This interest ultimately kick-started my career. I am proud to say that I am one of the few people who have truly benefited from using R in my professional life. Back then, using open source software in companies was uncommon, and many people preferred Matlab and other professional tools. People would often ask me who supported R and why it was free. However, I found that having this skill set was very beneficial.\nThe experience of using open source languages and technologies has been really helpful for me. Over the years, I have switched jobs and worked for different employers, but the knowledge I gained has always been useful in other settings and companies. Unlike bigger corporations, I never had to worry about buying licenses or running into budget issues. For example, Matlab is expensive, so it’s always a concern for some companies. But since I’ve had experience with open source technologies, I never had to deal with those issues.\nI learned about open source technologies during my university studies and discovered that they are free to use even in my professional career. This has been very helpful to me, and I am amazed at how far I have been able to go with it. Although R is not as widely used in the professional field as other languages, it has served me very well, and I am happy to be able to use it in my career. The Vienna R User Group allows me to bring it to the local R community.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Vienna?\nIt’s evident that the industry has started accepting open source, including R. I work primarily in the financial sector and pharma, which are industries where R is widely used. R is also a strong contender, alongside Python, in these fields.\nThe acceptance of using R in production environments is increasing, but some companies still view it as just a tool for creating graphs and nothing else. Despite this perception, I still use R a lot in production, and it works well. However, some wrong assumptions about using R in production are still present, which makes it challenging to deploy. Since R is a dynamic language and not compiled, some issues need to be addressed. Python also faces similar issues but is seen as easier to use. Although it is possible to use R in production, it depends on the department, as IT departments tend to be less accepting of R compared to the statistics or math departments.\nThere are always discussions regarding the best programming language to use in various industries. However, with the emergence of cloud technology and containerization, it is possible to package everything up into a nice container, making it work well. R is an industry-standard, and many risk departments in the financial industry use it to develop core models. Although people may complain and want to learn other languages like Python, R is still widely used.\nWhat industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?\nWe apply our expertise to various industries, including finance and pharmaceuticals. As external consultants, we assist clients in setting up proper procedures and creating useful dashboards and applications. We often work with existing R codes or other resources to improve their functionality and create helpful add-ons. Our focus is on maximizing existing knowledge and leveraging the existing code base. Our services often involve package creation, documentation, containerization, and dashboard framework development. We tailor our approach to suit the unique needs of each project.\nNowadays, we are developing more and more frameworks to set up departments in the industry with the right infrastructure. This includes developing R packages and connecting everything with the rest of the organization. Initially, we started by creating small models and calculations, but it gradually became more significant, and now we are mostly helping entire departments set themselves up in the right way and make the most of R and their people.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nThe trend of containerization has been around for some time now, where you package your app or REST API dashboard in a Docker container and deploy it in an environment such as the cloud. This trend is prevalent in both R and Python. As for upcoming trends, I am excited about the web assembly initiative, which makes it possible to run a Shiny app within a browser without a server. This initiative has great potential and can bring R to people who are unaware of its existence. It is exciting to see R bring data and statistics to life in various applications. I hope that this initiative can go further and reach more people.\nRegarding the deployment of our Shiny projects, it is always surprising to see how complicated it can be depending on the environment. This tool aims to make the deployment process easier and accessible to a broader audience. Currently, the loading times are still too long, but these issues can be optimized with some improvements.\nI have noticed another trend in certain industries, which is the increasing demand for regulatory compliance. For example, the FDA regulates the pharmaceutical industry, while finance has its own regulatory authorities. This trend encompasses ensuring that packages and codes are properly regulated and reviewed. I am seeing this trend in both the finance and pharmaceutical industries.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nWe have a GitHub page and a Meetup page, which is our setup. We tried to ensure that everything we present is also available, such as code and slides on GitHub, so that it’s easy for everyone to access. However, finding speakers and rooms is always a challenge. The good news is that finding rooms is getting easier than finding speakers. Some companies are always willing to host an hour-long meetup and have some online meetings. We are a group of smart people who like to talk about interesting things.\nThe most challenging aspect is locating speakers, particularly female speakers. I am pleased that initiatives like R Ladies provide a dedicated space for women in this field. Generally, finding speakers is a difficult task for us, and we rely heavily on referrals from friends and acquaintances. However, as a community, we always work to overcome this obstacle.\nIt’s important to always have a stream of topics and speakers available for events, but this can be difficult, especially when finding female speakers. Creating a welcoming and safe community where everyone feels comfortable sharing their knowledge is essential. Organizing these events is worth the effort, as you get to meet many like-minded people in your industry, and it can help you professionally. You’ll learn a lot and get to know people in your field, which is always an advantage. So, if you’re thinking of organizing meetups, just do it, and you’ll see how far it can take you.\nBefore COVID, our meetings were always in person. We tried recording them, but it didn’t work out. During COVID, we had to switch to online meetings only, and afterward, we started having hybrid meetings. I don’t find online meetups very satisfying because you miss out on the networking and socializing aspects. Going out to a bar or a pub and talking with people is an important part of the experience for me. That’s why I still prefer in-person meetups. However, thanks to COVID, things have changed, and I think we can now find more ways to combine the benefits of in-person and online meetings.\nYou are creating a lot of content that some people miss due to various reasons. There may be people who wanted to attend but couldn’t due to certain difficulties. To address this issue, we have now set up hybrid meetings, which require more equipment, like microphones and cameras. Most of the time, I have to carry this equipment. However, it makes sense to have this kind of content and share it with your community. Sometimes, speakers may not be happy about it, but it’s rare. Most of the time, it makes sense to do it hybrid.\nAs for the hybrid, I can say that recording can be difficult, and it rarely works out perfectly the first time around. However, I would recommend setting up a system that reduces your overhead for platforms like YouTube Live. Strive for minimal overhead to make your life easier. Don’t make the mistake we did once when Hadley Wickham was in town and we had to do a lot of editing and cutting because the recording wasn’t perfect. Instead, aim for a setup that works seamlessly and consider doing live streams instead.\nThe most practical way to share content with YouTube is to stream it live. This automatically uploads the content online, eliminating the need for further actions. As a result, when users visit the platform, the content is readily available for viewing.\nI have realized that delaying uploading our content to perform tasks such as editing and rearrangement is a time-consuming process that‌ does not offer significant benefits. Therefore, we are working towards improving our setup by acquiring high-quality microphones and mobile cameras to make the process more efficient and provide our viewers with a seamless experience.\nI am often amazed by the gratitude expressed by individuals around the world who get the opportunity to participate. Without the necessary infrastructure, achieving this would be impossible. However, some members of my community believe that it requires an excessive amount of work.\nIn light of the current global situation, people are less likely to travel or move to different cities for work or other purposes. Therefore, hybrid events are the most suitable way to improve accessibility and encourage community participation. Event organizers should consider using hybrid formats to provide a more inclusive and efficient experience for all participants."

    "text": "Federica Gazzelloni, co-organizer of R-Ladies Rome, recently spoke with the R Consortium about the fast-growing R community in Rome. The group collaborates with R user groups worldwide and has successfully attracted a diverse audience to its events. Federica also contributes to the R community through package development and is currently working on a book about using R for health metrics and tracking the spread of infectious diseases.\nThe group is hosting an online event titled “Building Reproducible Pipelines with R, Docker, and Nix” on the 29th of July. R users from around the world are invited to attend this event.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI am Federica Gazzelloni, an actuary and statistician interested in health studies. I am writing a book about health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases. As the lead organizer of R-Ladies Rome, one of the R user groups sponsored by the R Consortium, I am grateful for the support that enables us to organize monthly talks, tutorials, and workshops. Our events provide an inclusive and accessible learning environment free of charge, featuring exciting speakers and various engagement opportunities. Additionally, we have held events in partnership with R-Ladies New York, R-Ladies Paris, and Tunis R User Group and created a branded website: rladiesrome.org!\nR-Ladies Rome started in 2023 and has grown significantly since then. Our events consistently reach a substantial audience. For instance, our latest event with Isabella Velasquez garnered over 100 RSVPs. During Data Viz Month, we received unexpected attention from the open tech community of learners. Our followers on Meetup have reached over 1.1k, and our social media presence is steadily growing.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Rome?\nSince the kick-off of the chapter in 2023, R-Ladies Rome has played a pivotal role in fostering a dynamic community. We have successfully brought together an international group of R enthusiasts, ranging from beginners to experienced data scientists, creating a supportive and engaging environment for all. The popularity of the R language within the open source community, particularly for statistical analysis and medical research, is evident in Rome. R offers a wide range of libraries that can be easily applied to various topics, making it very convenient for users. Although Python is gaining attention in research and providing another accessible option for statistical analysis, the medical statistical community seems to prefer R over Python due to its extensive capabilities and strong community support.\nOur events have consistently attracted significant attention and participation. For example, our latest event with Isabella Velasquez garnered over 100 RSVPs. We have also received unexpected attention during Data Viz Month from the open tech community of learners. Our Meetup followers have reached over 1.1k, and our social media presence is steadily growing.\nThe R community in Rome is expected to grow, with R-Ladies Rome at its heart, driving engagement and promoting the use of R for various applications. We are excited to continue growing and evolving, providing valuable learning opportunities and fostering connections within the community.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language?\nWe have reviewed all the events that R-Ladies’ groups have organized in the past years and, after considering the rebranding of RStudio to Posit PBC and RMarkdown to Quarto, realized that several exciting trends in the R language are shaping its usage and development within the data science community. Analyzing event titles, attendee numbers, and activity on past recordings, we found that events containing “Introduction” or “Tutorials” impact learners most, highlighting the growing interest in learning R for data analytics, reproducible research, and dynamic reporting.\nMoreover, integrating R with other programming languages and platforms is gaining significant attention. The interoperability between R and languages like Python, HTML, or Java allows users to enhance their skills across multiple tools within a single environment. This has expanded R’s capabilities, making it a versatile choice for a diverse range of users.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nWe’ve been using Canva extensively for various tasks and found ChatGPT very helpful in crafting storytelling content. To enhance the planning and execution of events, Copilot assists with its excellent collaborative typing, saving time. Additionally, having a Meetup pro-account is valuable, mainly as R-Ladies Rome is part of the broader R Ladies group. It helps us connect with a wider audience while using Google Forms aids communication and prevents missing information. We also use YouTube and have our channel, which is very useful for sharing past events recordings and making them available online to ensure accessibility for those unable to attend live events.\nYou have a Meetup on “Building reproducible pipelines with R, Docker and Nix”, can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?\nWe have an upcoming Meetup titled “Building reproducible pipelines with R, Docker and Nix” , featuring speaker Bruno Rodrigues. This topic was chosen based on feedback from our organizers, Silvana Acosta and Rafael Ribeiro, who polled our audience to identify a favorite speaker. Bruno Rodrigues emerged as a popular choice, highlighting the growing interest in robust and reproducible data science workflows.\nIn this session, Bruno Rodrigues will guide us through setting up reproducible data pipelines using R, Docker, and Nix. These tools ensure that data analyses are consistent and can be easily shared and replicated across different environments. By learning to use Docker and Nix alongside R, our community members will gain valuable skills to enhance the reliability and reproducibility of their data science projects. This event aligns with our mission to provide practical and impactful learning opportunities that meet the evolving needs of the data science community.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nOne of the key projects I am currently working on involves a quarto-book titled “Health Metrics and the Spread of Infectious Diseases with R”, which CRC Press will publish at the end of this year. This book aims to provide comprehensive insights into the intersection of health metrics, such as DALYs and infectious disease dynamics, using advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques in R. The goal is to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to analyze and interpret health data effectively, thereby contributing to the broader field of public health.\nIn addition to the book, I have developed a couple of R data packages to aid in data analysis and visualization. One is “oregonfrogs,” which is expected to go on CRAN very soon. This package focuses on classification modeling for detecting frog habitats, utilizing spatial techniques. It provides a valuable function, longlat_to_utm(). The development of these packages showcases R’s versatility in handling complex ecological data and emphasizes the importance of open source tools in advancing scientific research. Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate the practical applications of R in public health and environmental science, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of data-driven methodologies."

    "title": "Bridging Gaps: Tunis R User Group’s Journey in Democratizing R in Bioinformatics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year, the R Consortium had a conversation with Amal Tlili, the co-organizer of the Tunis R User Group, regarding the Use of R for Marketing and CRM in Tunisia. This year, Amal Boukteb and Hedia Tnani spoke to the R Consortium about the use of R for bioinformatics research in Tunisia and discussed the group’s efforts to bridge the gap between academia and industry. The Tunis R User Group hosts engaging virtual events to connect R enthusiasts across the MENA region and Worldwide. Their events promote the use of R and foster knowledge and skill development in data science and bioinformatics.\nHédia and Amal met during the Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses course at Pasteur Institute of Tunis in 2017. Amal joined Tunis R User Group as a Bioinformatics Event Organizer\nin 2023. With a deep commitment to inclusivity and empowerment, they’ve dedicated themselves to breaking down barriers faced by women and individuals from low-income countries when accessing education in these cutting-edge areas. By organizing workshops tailored to these communities, they aim to provide valuable skills and knowledge and foster a more diverse and equitable future in the bioinformatics field.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nAmal: We are biologists, and our academic curriculum did not include any programming courses. However, with the advancement of sequencing technologies, biologists are now facing the challenge of analyzing vast amounts of genomic data. This is a significant challenge for us. For my PhD project, I was involved in RNA-Seq and RAD-Seq projects. To overcome this challenge, I attended a course on analyzing genomic data using Unix, where I met Hedia for the first time. Additionally, in the framework of my thesis project,  I had the opportunity to visit the Plant Immunity Group at RIKEN Yokohama in Japan for an internship. While there, I learned a lot from the talented scientists and their exciting research in bioinformatics.\nWhen it comes to learning R programming for biologists, no specific courses are available. The only courses that exist are general ones. So, to overcome this gap, I started learning by myself. I attempted to understand the concepts by reading through error messages, package tutorials, and watching YouTube tutorials.\nWe realized we faced the same challenge after discussing this issue with our colleagues. We have genomic data that we need to analyze, but the available courses are located outside of Tunisia, primarily in Europe. Unfortunately, we lack the financial support to attend these courses. Additionally, obtaining a student visa for a temporary stay to attend such courses is a complex process. This challenge is not only unique to Tunisians but also a struggle for Africans and many biologists from middle and low-income countries. Our Tunis R user group aims to help others overcome this challenge and bridge this gap.\nHedia: I studied agronomy first and then pursued a master’s degree in plant breeding from Spain. Later, I completed my PhD in genetics. I did not know programming or R during my studies in Tunisia and Spain. However, when I started my postdoc at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, especially when I first faced analyzing genomics data, I felt out of my depth. With no programming experience, learning R seemed like a mountain too steep to climb. This is a familiar story for many biologists transitioning from wet to dry labs, where code replaces beakers. Despite the daunting challenge, I persevered and taught myself R; eventually, it became an invaluable tool for my research. I’m also thankful to the great mentors I had at IRRI who helped me accelerate my learning curve. My journey wasn’t easy, but it was incredibly rewarding.\nLearning bioinformatics can be challenging, especially in regions like Tunisia where resources are scarce and training abroad is so costly. Moreover, the need for bioinformatics training to solve biological problems has left many highly skilled biologists struggling to find a job in their field. Recognizing these obstacles, we formed a supportive community to facilitate collective learning and growth in bioinformatics and related fields such as data science and artificial intelligence.\nOur community is a friendly, inclusive, and welcoming space for anyone passionate about bioinformatics, data science, artificial intelligence, and beyond. We’re all about growing together and learning from each other in a supportive environment. Whether you’re just starting out or have lots of experience, we encourage you to dive in, ask questions, and share your insights. We all rise by lifting others. Don’t worry about asking the “wrong” question. Every question is a chance to understand and learn something new. Come join us and be part of our journey of discovery and growth. We can’t wait to learn with you!\nCan you share what the R community is like in Tunisia?\nHedia: In Tunisia, programming is mainly used in the industry, but it is not widely taught in the curriculum for biologists. This creates a gap between what is taught in the academic courses and what is required in the industry. As a result, individuals are expected to possess programming skills when they work in the industry. Still, they may not have been able to learn programming during their academic courses. This gap must be addressed to better prepare individuals for the job market.\nCan you please update us about the group’s recent activities?\nAmal: First, it is important to mention that Arabic is our native language in Tunisia. However, French is the predominant teaching language in many subjects, including biology and informatics. Despite this, we have decided to conduct our workshop in English for the Tunis user group for two main reasons. Firstly, we aim to bridge the gap between the academic skills acquired in French and English resources. Secondly, by using English as our teaching language, we can reach a broader audience of scientists who share our needs.\nWe decided to allow us the flexibility to choose speakers without language barriers. Our main goal is to reach a broad audience worldwide. During our workshop, we noticed participants worldwide, not just Tunisians. This is very important to us. We conducted workshops for biologists, such as the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) workshop, and we already have 5k views on our YouTube channel. It is interesting to see that people are very interested in our workshops. We also had the opportunity to collaborate with highly qualified researchers in their respective fields. Within our community, we were privileged to learn from Pr. Emerson Del Ponte generously shared his expertise using R for Plant Disease Epidemiology.\nWe aim not only to cover biological subjects but also those related to artificial intelligence. Recently, we conducted two successful workshops on Building a Chatbot with OpenAI, Shiny and R, and Bioinformatics Analysis using Chatlize and ChatGPT. We strive to have a balance between biological and AI-related subjects to make the experience easier for our participants with the help of artificial intelligence.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language?\nHedia: In bioinformatics, there is a growing trend towards single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Our latest event was an introduction to single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Additionally, packages based on OpenAI API are increasingly being used. For instance, many of those packages can be used by people who lack coding skills. This is particularly helpful because not all biologists possess coding skills, and it makes their work easier. Another trend we have noticed is using Quarto instead of R Markdown. Shiny is also gaining popularity in this field.\nWe have been receiving a lot of queries about bioinformatics workshops lately, particularly because they offer a diverse range of events, such as user groups. However, it can be challenging to find a specific topic. For instance, some R user groups may only hold one or two events yearly, whereas we host monthly bioinformatics events.\nWe value feedback from our attendees and gather suggestions from our latest events to improve our upcoming ones. Our events are designed to stay current with trends in the industry, and we often invite guest speakers to talk about relevant topics. For instance, during one of our workshops about Building a Chatbot with OpenAI, we had 200 participants whom we taught how to use R and create their chatbots. We learn from our experiences, and when we notice an interest in a particular area, we look to bring in speakers to teach on that subject.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nHedia: Our organization had a sponsorship for our Zoom account, an important tool for hosting events. One of the features that we utilize is the captions option, which allows participants from all over the world to have captions in their language and helps them follow the workshop. This is particularly helpful for those who may have difficulty understanding English. We are very grateful to Appsilon for their sponsorship of our Zoom account.\nAmal: Thanks to Appsilon’s sponsorship, we have accepted more participants for our events. Previously, the number of participants was limited due to the capacity of our Zoom account. However, with this sponsorship, we can now handle up to 100 participants per event. This has made it easier for us to accept more subscribers and host successful workshops. We recently had an event with over 200 participants, which was a great success.\nHedia: We provide teaching materials for our speaker sessions on GitHub. You can find all the materials on YouTube and use them to reproduce what the speaker did during their session. We are always open to questions, especially if you encounter bugs while trying to reproduce the speaker’s work. Recently, we received an email from a participant experiencing a bug, and we had a great time figuring it out together. If you have any questions or problems, feel free to ask us for help, and we’ll do our best to assist you.\nAre your events online, in-person, or hybrid?\nHedia: We are considering organizing hybrid events in the future, and we are searching for funding. We only have sponsorship for our Zoom, so we need additional funds to make this happen. We plan to organize events at multiple universities across the MENA region so important speakers can be followed in person and online. Amal, who is based in Tunis, has been in contact with many universities and academic professionals in the area. We’re currently exploring the best ways to make these hybrid events a reality, ensuring a seamless and enriching experience for everyone involved. Our goal is to make these events as engaging and accessible as possible, fostering a true sense of community.\nWe want to organize events for online events and to provide something valuable to our community. When we meet in person, we can better understand their needs and challenges, which helps us to build and organize workshops that cater to their specific needs. Recently, Amal mentioned that some courses are not free in Tunisia, which can be a barrier for some people. Therefore, we aim to organize a free hybrid event for everyone who wants to join and learn with us. We hope to get funding for this initiative to provide this opportunity to all.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nAmal: For my PhD project, I conducted research on population genomics and RNA-seq to investigate the interaction between plants and parasitic plants. Our work shed light on the genetic diversity of Orobanche foetida, a parasitic plant posing a significant threat to faba beans in Tunisia. Additionally, through RNA-seq analysis, we identified a potential target gene for developing resistant varieties of faba beans against this parasitic plant. Furthermore, I recently completed a bachelor’s degree in biostatistics, specifically focusing on Aphid diversity in Tunisia.\nDuring my academic journey, R has been my primary tool for conducting comprehensive data analysis across all my research projects. After finishing my PhD, I aim to develop my expertise in bioinformatics further, specifically focusing on wheat genomics.\nHedia: I primarily use R as the main software for all my research projects. I am currently working on maintaining and improving a package called qsvaR. qsvaR is a tool that generates quality surrogate variable analysis for degradation correction in RNA cells. It contains functions that help remove the degradation effect in post-mortem brain tissue, making it a useful tool for generating basic data. We are currently working on a publication based on this work."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Isabella Velasquez, co-organizer of R-Ladies Seattle, recently spoke with the R Consortium about her journey with R and the group’s recent activities. Isabella started as a beginner but has become a key figure in the R community thanks to the supportive and collaborative learning environment. R-Ladies Seattle regularly hosts in-person, hybrid, and online events, such as casual happy hours, lightning talks, and collaborations with other user groups. The group engages its members through creative activities and uses tools like GitHub for event planning. Their commitment to inclusivity and continuous learning helps maintain a dynamic and supportive community for R users in Seattle.\nR-Ladies Seattle is seeking speakers for an upcoming lightning talks session. If you are interested in presenting, please contact Isabella.\nPersonal website | Twitter | Mastodon\nPlease share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI first encountered R when I started my graduate program in 2014. I was pursuing a Master’s in Analytics in Chicago. The program mainly revolved around using R. At that time, I was a complete beginner and had to start from the basics, like installing R. Since the program was fairly new, there wasn’t a well-structured curriculum for introducing R. It was assumed that students would either pick it up or already have some knowledge. The coursework focused on R from there.\nMy older brother Gustavo was a great resource when I started learning R and picking up the necessary skills. He is a highly proficient R user, so I asked him for help. He introduced me to many tools that made it much easier for a beginner to work in RStudio and pick up the tidyverse syntax. The main course curriculum was open to different approaches to using R, which provided flexibility in learning the tools and skills that interested me the most.\nAfter completing my program in 2016, I landed my first job as a data analyst. I began using R and regularly working with data. Back then, Twitter was buzzing with activity. I stayed enthusiastic and continued learning from the community. My brother and I collaborated to solve problems and acquire new skills. At work, my team had diverse tool proficiency; some were adept in Excel, while others had data expertise. Eventually, we formed a learning community and collectively mastered R. We utilized R to generate presentations, reports, visualizations, and clean up data. It was fantastic to have a small community at work and a larger one outside through social media.\nOne of my colleagues, Chaya Jones, at my previous workplace, where I worked as a data analyst, was one of the original co-organizers for R-Ladies Seattle. The R user group had just started in 2018, and she invited me to join and give one of the earliest presentations for R-Ladies Seattle. Over time, the membership grew, and eventually, I became one of the co-organizers. My role involved coordinating events, finding speakers, and other related tasks.\nI am very fortunate because I got into R in a friendly and collaborative environment. During graduate school, I collaborated with classmates and gained valuable knowledge from my brother. Later, I landed a new data analyst job and had a whole team of people who were interested in learning and using R. It has truly been a joy, and I feel appreciative for how well things have worked out and for the length of time that I’ve been able to use R.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Seattle?\nAs I mentioned, my workplace involved various programming languages, but there were quite a few R users. We used to have these small study groups where we discussed creating an R Markdown template for our company and shared Shiny apps and other similar things. The field I worked in was education, but in Seattle, you see a lot of R being used in bioinformatics and scientific research related to diseases. It’s very popular among those groups, and they have solid user groups where they grow and learn together. Many members of R Ladies Seattle are from organizations like Fred Hutch, where the emphasis on using R is very strong, which is pretty great.\nEvery month, R-Ladies Seattle hosts a casual happy hour. We have good chips and salsa, and it’s a great opportunity for members to join, chat, and have a good time. Additionally, after the Cascadia R Conference in June, we will have a social hour where people can keep the conversation going in a relaxed setting. We will also host a social hour at the end of posit::conf in August, and R-Ladies who didn’t attend the conference are more than welcome to join and hang out. We organize many social events, so there are plenty of opportunities to connect with us.\nWe have some exciting events related to R coming up. We are currently looking for speakers for a lightning talk session, where individuals can quickly share the projects they are working on or a tool they love. It’s a low-pressure way to join in, and we welcome anyone who would like to sign up and participate.\nOur focus is primarily on in-person and hybrid events. While we have seen an explosion of online events after COVID-19, it’s important to uphold the Seattle community by providing opportunities for local participation. Generally, our events are held in person, with occasional hybrid events. However, we are also excited about organizing online events with Seattle residents in mind at a convenient time for the Pacific Time Zone. Our offering of in-person, hybrid, and online events provides a unique experience for our user group in Seattle.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people who are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nOne thing we implemented was to think of events that could generate high engagement. For example, with our Hex sticker, we organized a competition for all R-Ladies members to participate by submitting their designs, followed by a voting process. It was a lot of fun, both creatively and in terms of getting everyone involved. We strive to come up with similar engaging activities. Additionally, when appropriate, we reach out to other user groups in the area to explore collaboration opportunities, co-hosting events, or simply support each other’s promotions to foster a strong sense of community.\nOne method we have tried for planning events is using GitHub discussions to log our ideas for events and determine which events are the most popular based on comments and upvotes. This helps guide our future event planning.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing shortly?\nEvery year, we send out a survey to inquire about people’s interests and what they like to see. The responses are usually a mix of technical content, with many requests for intermediate-level information. There’s a lot of interest from people in Seattle who use R in some capacity or are members of R-Ladies Seattle. They are looking for opportunities to upskill based on their existing knowledge of R. Additionally, there are many requests for information about career advancement and available positions.\nThere are various job titles related to data, such as data scientist and data engineer. Many people have questions about the career prospects in this field, including the potential for advancement and available options. These are common topics of discussion.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nI now work at Posit, formerly RStudio, in a marketing role. I still get to work with R a lot, which is great for creating dashboards to track various metrics. I’ve been focusing on defining metrics of success and similar tasks.\nRecently, I created a dashboard in Shiny that refreshes daily to compile the information I need for my to-do list. Every morning, I check my Shiny dashboard to see my daily tasks. It pulls information from my project management tool, so I only have to update one place to see an aggregated view of my month. It was fun to do this in R with Shiny.\nRecently, I worked on creating a custom template in Quarto for the upcoming R Medicine Conference website. The website is built entirely on Quarto, a new tool similar to R Markdown. My work specifically involved designing the events page to display previous events and provide links to the event page and YouTube playlist. It’s exciting to learn and work with new tools like Quarto."

    "title": "Building Data Highways: Kirill Müller’s Journey in Enhancing R’s Database",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Kirill Müller is the author of the {DBI} package, which helps to connect R and database management systems (DBMS). The connection to a DBMS is achieved through database-specific backend packages that implement this interface, such as RPostgres, RMariaDB, and RSQLite. There’s more information here. Most users who want to access a database do not need to install DBI directly. It will be installed automatically when one of the database backends is installed. If you are new to DBI, the introductory tutorial is an excellent starting point for familiarizing yourself with essential concepts.\n{DBI} supports about 30 DBMS, including:\nYour latest work with the R Consortium was focused on the maintenance and support for {DBI}, the {DBItest} test suite, and the 3 backends to open source databases ({RSQLite}, {RMariaDB} and {RPostgres}). You stated that “Keeping compatibility with the evolving ecosystem (OS, databases, R itself, other packages) is vital for the long-term success of the project.” What’s the current status?\nDBI and the other projects are available for use. Please try them!\nI always strive for a healthy, “green” build, prioritizing clean and efficient outcomes. However, given the complexity of the projects, with their many moving parts and the continuous influx of new developments, achieving perfection at all times can be challenging. My goal is to ensure that everything we build meets a standard of functionality, even if there are moments when the builds don’t meet every expectation.\nFortunately, the generous funding provided by the R Consortium empowers us to address and rectify any issues as they emerge. This financial support is crucial, as it allows for the immediate tackling of problems, ensuring that our projects remain on the cutting edge and continue to serve the community effectively. Despite the occasional imperfections, my commitment is to promptly and efficiently solve these problems, maintaining the high quality and reliability of our builds.\nMore information available here.\nIs performance an issue with big data sets? Does R have performance advantages or disadvantages compared to other languages?\nR has unique strengths as a powerful interface language. R treats data frames as first-class data structures. Functions and expressions are first-class objects, enabling easy parsing, computing, and emitting code, fostering robust programming practices. Moreover, R’s “pass by value” semantics (to be more accurate, “pass by reference and copy on write) ensure that functions do not inadvertently alter your data. This eliminates concerns over state management and makes data manipulation both predictable and secure.\nDespite performance considerations, R is adept at efficiently handling bulk data operations. For example, working with columnar data frames that contain anywhere from 100,000 to 3 million rows is smooth due to R’s vectorized approach, allowing for efficient column-wise addition or multiplication. However, the performance can decline if large data frames are processed cell by cell.\nAnd here’s the true power of R: As an interface language, R enables the use of external, high-speed engines—be it DuckDB, Arrow, traditional databases, or data processing tools like data.table and collapse—for computation, while R itself is used to compose the commands for these engines. This integration showcases R’s versatility and efficiency by leveraging the strengths of these specialized engines for heavy lifting, thereby bypassing its performance limitations in certain areas.\nTherefore, the focus should not be just on performance in isolation but rather on what can be achieved through R’s integration with other systems. This flexibility allows R to extend its utility well beyond mere data processing, making it a potent tool not only for technical users but also accessible to those with less technical expertise. The intuitive syntax of R, especially with domain-specific languages like dplyr, makes it exceptionally user-friendly, resembling plain English and facilitating a smoother workflow for a wide range of tasks.\nWho uses databases and R most? Are they already using R and need to connect to different types of DBMS?\nAs an interface language, R is remarkably versatile. It is designed to facilitate connections with a broad spectrum of tools and systems. This versatility positions R as a central hub for orchestrating a wide range of tasks, enabling users to maintain their workflow within the platform without wrestling with complex interfaces. Command-line interfaces are acceptable, offering a decent level of control and flexibility. File-based interfaces, on the other hand, can be cumbersome and inefficient, making them far from ideal for dynamic data management tasks.\nThe spectrum of interfaces available for database interaction varies. The most effective solution is an R package that includes bindings to a library. This setup provides a direct conduit to the necessary functionality, streamlining the interaction process. Examples are DBI backends for PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, and ODBC, or the new ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) standard (more on that later). These backends facilitate direct, low-friction access to databases from within R.\nFocusing on native solutions, I want to emphasize the potential of the dm package, which I see as offering substantial benefits beyond what the DBI backends might provide. The dm package closely integrates database concepts with R. It enables sophisticated operations, such as the management of data models with primary and foreign keys, execution of complex joins, and the transformation of data frames into a fully operational data warehouse within R. These capabilities extend and enhance the functionalities provided by dplyr, dbplyr, and DBI, offering a comprehensive toolkit for database management directly through R.\nRMySQL is being phased out in favor of the new RMariaDB package. Why?\nWhen I first got involved with the DBI Library, it was after being awarded my first contract, which focused on connecting R to SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB. It’s important to note that MariaDB and MySQL are essentially related; MariaDB is a fork of MySQL. Despite their independent evolution, they remain largely interchangeable, allowing connections to either MariaDB or MySQL databases without much trouble. This similarity can sometimes cause confusion.\nIn terms of technical specifics, our MySQL package utilizes C to create bindings to its underlying library, while our DBI package prefers C++, which I find more user-friendly for these tasks. When I took charge of the project, these packages were already separate, and I didn’t challenge that decision. Starting anew offers the benefit of not needing to maintain backward compatibility with existing our MySQL users, which has posed significant challenges, especially with the RSQLite package. That package’s widespread use across several hundred other packages meant we had to conduct reverse dependency checks, running tests from those packages against modifications in ours to ensure compatibility. This process, essentially an enhanced test suite, required considerable effort.\nReflecting on it now, I would have preferred to initiate a project like RSQLite, to begin with a clean slate. Starting fresh allows for quicker progress without the constraints of backward compatibility or the expectation of maintaining behaviors that may no longer be relevant or supported. However, you also want to avoid alienating your user base. So, transitioning to C++ and starting from scratch was a strategic choice, and it was one that the maintainer of our MySQL and I agreed upon.\nI should mention the odbc package, which isn’t included in the scope of R Consortium projects but is essential to our work. We use the odbc package extensively to connect with a variety of commercial databases and specialized database systems, some of which might not offer a straightforward method for direct interaction. In our setup, the odbc package acts as a crucial database interface, bridging the gap between the database itself and DBI.\nThere’s been a significant new development in this space, known as ADBC, accompanied by an R package named adbi. This initiative, spearheaded by Voltron Data, represents a modern reimagining of ODBC, specifically designed to enhance analytical workflows. While traditional databases have been geared towards both reading and writing data, ADBC focuses on optimizing data reading and analysis, recognizing that data science and data analysis workflows predominantly require efficient data reading capabilities. This focus addresses a gap left by ODBC, which wasn’t originally designed with high-speed data analysis in mind.\nThese developments are exciting, and I’m keen to see what the future holds for us in this evolving landscape.\nWhat’s the difference between DBI and dbplyr?\nI could describe it as a relationship between DBI and dbplyr, where dbplyr acts as a user of DBI. DBI supplies the essential functionality that enables dbplyr to operate effectively. This setup allows dbplyr to concentrate on constructing SQL queries, while other packages handle the responsibility of connecting to the individual databases.\nWhat are the biggest issues with using R and databases moving forward?\nThe current DBI project faces challenges that are tough to solve within its existing scope. These challenges could significantly impact many dependent components, which is why this repository has little code and serves mainly as a placeholder for ideas we think DBI is missing. However, these ideas have the potential to become significant enhancements.\nOne major technical challenge I’ve faced is with query cancellation. If a query runs too long, the only option is to terminate the process, which stops our entire session. This issue is closely related to the concept of asynchronous processing, where a query is sent off, and other tasks are done in parallel until the query results are ready. This would be especially useful in applications like Shiny, allowing it to handle multiple user sessions simultaneously within the same R process. Finding a solution to this problem is crucial due to the current lack of effective alternatives in our infrastructure.\nWhile not every issue signifies a major problem, there are certainly areas that DBI does not address, some of which may be beyond its intended scope. Still, there are notable gaps that require attention.\nAs for our original plan, we’re taking a different direction thanks to the introduction of the ADBC via the adbi package. ADBC offers a stronger foundation for achieving our goals. With ADBC, all data is funneled through the Arrow data format, which means we no longer need individual backends to translate data into R data frames separately, and at the same time other ecosystems can be integrated easier. In addition, a substantial part of the known challenges for DBI, including query cancellation and asynchronous processing, are already solved by ADBC. Using ADBC as a bridge between databases and ecosystems reduces the complexity from a many-to-many (n × m) problem to a more manageable one-to-one (n + m) problem. This reduces duplication of effort and makes it easy to support new databases or new ecosystems. More information here.\nHow has it been working with the R Consortium? Would you recommend applying for an ISC grant to other R developers?\nThis is an excellent opportunity for young professionals to secure funding for their ideas or explore areas that haven’t been fully addressed yet. R is a fantastic tool, but it constantly evolves with new technologies being introduced. I’m particularly impressed by how the consortium supports various projects, including R-Ladies and SatRdays, which promote inclusivity within the community. I was approached with the idea of applying for a project, something I might not have considered alone. This makes me curious whether there’s a list of challenges similar to what the Google Summer of Code offers, where potential mentors submit project ideas for students to work on under their guidance. I haven’t looked into this possibility for the consortium in detail yet, but the thought of it excites me. I thoroughly enjoy being part of this process and am eager to see what long-term collaborations might emerge from it."

    "title": "Pharma RUG: The Rise of R in China’s Pharmaceutical Industry",
    "section": "",
    "text": "PharmaRUG, China organizer Joe Zhu, spoke with the R Consortium about the growing R community and the increasing use of R in the pharmaceutical industry in China. The group has contributed to the pharmaceutical R community through several R packages. Since its establishment last year, the group has organized large-scale hybrid events. Joe also shared some tools and techniques for smoothly organizing and running hybrid events.\n\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI have a PhD in statistics and studied in New Zealand for my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in statistics. My PhD work focused on theoretical coalescent theory and probabilistic modeling for phylogenetics models. I also completed a postdoc at Oxford, focusing on statistical genomics for the human genome and malaria parasite genome projects. During this time, I developed open source software tools for statistical genomics, primarily using R as a front end and developing C++ software.\nFor the past four years, I’ve worked at Roche, where I started leading a major collaboration initiative in pharma three years ago. I’ve created TLG (table, listing, and figures) for regulatory submissions to the FDA. Throughout this initiative, we have open sourced around 30 software packages, including `formatters`, `rtables`, `rlistings` and `tern`. Last year, we submitted these packages to CRAN.\nAt first, we open sourced the project on GitHub and then submitted it to CRAN. I’m heavily involved in one of China’s R user groups, PharmaRUG. We use the group to share posts about developments in the area, and we organize events and conferences. In March last year, we hosted the first event with over 100 people on-site and around 100 online. The event covered topics like R package usage in the pharma industry. Later that year, we organized another event called “Open Source Clinical Reporting summeR“. \n\nLately, I have been busy organizing several events. I recently gave a talk (about R package dependencies as directed in acyclic graphs) at a conference hosted by the R community in China. Early next month, on August 1st, I will attend a pharma conference where I will conduct a workshop on good practices in software package development. The conference schedule is quite packed for me as I also have a session on how teams operate and collaborate within the Pharma industry to develop R packages. On the third day of the conference, I will organize a series of 11 data visualization talks, one of which is about Python. Most of the talks will focus on using R, except for one discussion on Python.\nCan you share what the R community is like in China? \n\nWe have opened up seats for students to join our events in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past, fewer than 20 students, mostly from academia, have joined us for these conferences. The events include big names like Roche, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Sanofi and local companies such as Fosun, Hengrui, and Legend Biotech. There is a big R community in China across academia and industry. Our user group primarily focuses on the pharma industry. Our WeChat channel has nearly a thousand subscribers, and our group chat has almost 500 members. It’s a very active community. \nLater this year, we will collaborate with the “R in Pharma” for the October conference. Daniel Sabanes Bove and I have contacted Harvey and Phil, and we will organize an APAC track, including India, China, Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Korea. \nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nWe have created a GitHub account called PharmaRUG. We use this platform to share websites, posts, slides, and videos related to our events. The Pharma RUG 2024 conference was particularly successful this year, thanks to the support from the R Consortium. We also utilize WeChat groups to call for speakers and interact with others. In addition to GitHub and WeChat, we use Tencent Docs to share documents. This is particularly useful in China, where using company-specific platforms like Google or Microsoft can be hindered by firewalls. Tencent Docs works perfectly in China, making sharing and synchronizing documents easy.\nCan you share some valuable tips for organizing succesful Hybrid events?\n\nWe have a series of planning sessions where we actively communicate using WeChat. We meet at a community center where everyone is open, and we have preset meetings. We test the audio and everything beforehand. This is our second year organizing these events, so we have gained more experience. We are now familiar with the standards and know what needs to be done. For example, when two companies, like MNCs, use different systems, we find it better to use one shared system to ensure everything is synchronized.\nWe’ve found that Microsoft Teams is easy to use for setting up meetings and scheduling them ahead of time. For live demos, we recommend pre-recording the demos and taking questions. In the case of hybrid sessions with multiple locations, we prioritize asking and answering questions based on the primary and secondary locations, as well as online participation. If we cannot answer questions quickly, we host Q&A sessions afterward and share them online.\nI believe that for the event to be successful, timing is crucial. We must stick to the schedule because it’s a hybrid event. However, we should also allow for some flexibility when unexpected things come up. We haven’t created a YouTube account yet because YouTube isn’t accessible in China. One alternative could be setting up a Bilibili web page and account to share the videos. All our files are currently on GitHub, which is convenient. We need to trim the videos to smaller sizes to fit GitHub’s file size limits, maybe at four and a half speeds or similar.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry?\nSo, SAS has dominated the software space for the Pharma industry for decades. While it used to be used for exploratory and research purposes, there have been successes with using Office to support missions in recent years. Roche also has success stories in this area. There are several initiatives, with PharmaVerse being a significant player. Roche is part of PharmaVerse, taking inspiration from the tidyverse multiverse concept. The end-to-end clinical reporting process is considered in this space, from data preparation to TLG generations. A lot has happened in the past three to four years, especially in China last year. There’s been significant development in China, and you can see a shift from SAS to R in the tools used. At the PharmaSUG meeting, which was previously dominated by SAS users, in the past few years, a quarter to one-third of the tools are using languages other than SAS. It’s clear that things are moving away from SAS towards software languages like R.\nThis year, I don’t have the complete statistics with me right now, but you do see a lot of topics. In my session, I’m sharing, and you know, many talks use visualization because it’s much likable. So, the trend is that R is becoming more acceptable than before, from PLCs to things in production. There are very high standards for codes and validation.\nIn the end, I would like to thank my dear friends and colleagues for their support and for making this happen\n\nYan Qiao, Associate Director of Scientific Programming, Beigene, \nBaoqin Li, China Head Clinical & Statical Programming, Johnson & Johnson\nDong Guo, China head of Stats Analyst, Eli-lilly&Company\nYun Ma, Director, clinical data Sciences, Boehringer Ingelheim (china) Investment Co.\nYanli Chang, Head of Data Operations China, Novartis\n\nHow do I Join?\nR Consortium’s R User Group and Small Conference Support Program (RUGS) provides grants to help R groups organize, share information, and support each other worldwide. We have given grants over the past four years, encompassing over 68,000 members in 33 countries. We would like to include you!

    "text": "The R Consortium recently talked with Natalia Andriychuk, Statistical Data Scientist at Pfizer and co-founder of the RTP R User Group (Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina), to get details about her experience supporting the Pfizer R community and starting a local R user group.\nShe started her R journey over 7 years ago, and since then, she has been passionate about open source development. She is a member of the Interactive Safety Graphics Task Force within the American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Safety Working Group, which is developing graphical tools for the drug safety community.\nNatalia Andriychuk at posit:conf 2023\nPlease share your background and involvement with the R community at Pfizer and beyond.\nFrom 2015 to 2022, I worked at a CRO (Contract Research Organization) in various roles, where I discovered my passion for Data Science after being introduced to R, JavaScript, and D3 by my talented colleagues. I became a part of an amazing team where I learned valuable skills.\nLater, when I began looking for new career opportunities, I knew that I wanted to focus on R. I sought a role that would deepen my R skills and further advance my R knowledge. This is how I came to join Pfizer in 2022 and became a part of the amazing team. I am a Statistical Data Scientist in the R Center of Excellence SWAT (Scientific Workflows and Analytic Tools) team.\nPfizer SWAT team at posit::conf2023 (left to right: Natalia Andriychuk, Mike K Smith, Sam Parmar, James Kim)\nThe R Center of Excellence (CoE) supports various business lines at Pfizer. We provide technical expertise, develop training on R and associated tools, promote best practices, and build a community of R users within Pfizer. Our community currently consists of over 1,200 members.\nI will present Pfizer’s R CoE progress and initiatives during the R Consortium R Adoption Series Webinar on February 8th at 3:00 pm EST.\nMy first introduction to the R community was through the posit::conf (previously known as rstudio::conf) in 2018. Attending the conference allowed me to witness the welcoming nature of the R community. Five years later, in 2023, I made it to the speakers’ list and presented at the posit::conf 2023. It was an incredible experience!\nI also follow several other avenues to connect with R community members. As the name suggests, I read R Weekly weekly and attend the Data Science Hangout led by Rachael Dempsey at Posit. Every Thursday, Rachael invites a data science community leader to be a featured guest and share their unique experiences with the audience. Fortunately, I was invited as a featured guest to one of the Posit Data Science Hangouts. I shared my experience organizing and hosting an internal R at Pfizer Hangout.\nCan you share your experience of starting the RTP (Research Triangle Park) R User Group?\nNicholas Masel and I co-organize the RTP R User Group in our area. We formed the RTP R User Group in 2023 and have held three meetings‌: meet-and-greet, social hour, and a posit::conf 2023 watch party.\nRTP R User Group Social Hour Gathering\nWe hope to expand and increase attendance at our meetups in 2024. We currently have approximately 74 members who joined the online meetup group, and we look forward to meeting all of them in person moving forward.\nCan you share what the R community is like in the RTP area?\nNicholas and I both work in the pharmaceutical industry, and thus far, our in-person user group meetings have predominantly included individuals from this field. However, we want to emphasize that our user group is open to everyone, regardless of industry or background.\nThe RTP area has great potential for a thriving R User Group. We are surrounded by three major universities (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and North Carolina State University), the growing high-technology community and a notable concentration of life science companies. We anticipate attracting more students in the coming year, especially those studying biostatistics or statistics and using R in their coursework. We also look forward to welcoming individuals from various industries and backgrounds to foster a rich and collaborative R user community.\nPlease share about a project you are working on or have worked on using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nI am an open source development advocate, believing in the transformative power of collaborative innovation and knowledge sharing. I am a member of the Interactive Safety Graphics (ISG) Task Force, part of the American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Safety Working Group. The group comprises volunteers from the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, and academia to develop creative and innovative interactive graphical tools following the open source paradigm. Our task force is developing a collection of R packages for clinical trial safety evaluation. The {safetyGraphics} package we developed provides an easy-to-use shiny interface for creating shareable safety graphics for any clinical study.\n{safetyGraphics} supports multiple chart types including web-based interactive graphics using {htmlwidgets}\nWe are preparing to share three new interactive visualizations we developed in 2023 during the upcoming ASA-DIA Safety Working Group Quarterly Scientific Webinar – Q1 2024 on January 30 (11:00 – 12:30 EST). Participating in the ISG Task Force has been an invaluable experience that allowed me to learn from talented data scientists and expand my professional network."

He specializes in programming languages, compilers, and systems. Notably, he developed one of the first real-time Java virtual machines in collaboration with Boeing, which involved writing the navigation software of a ScanEagle UAV in Java and demonstrating that it out-performed the legacy version of the system written in C++. Vitek is actively involved in the programming language community and has held multiple leadership roles, including chairing SIGPLAN. In his spare time Vitek is a cinephile with a presence on Letterboxd and is the human of a dog named Olaf.\nVitek has been working on R for a decade. He is currently working on the MaintainR 2021 project, which aims to support and update the key components of the R ecosystem. The R Consortium is funding this project.\nCan you provide an overview of the MaintainR 2021 project and its main objectives?\n“When does a programming language die?” is the wrong question. Languages do not die, they slowly fade into irrelevance. A language fades away when no longer deemed useful enough for people to learn it and convince their colleagues to adopt it in their work and to maintain software projects written in it. Why does this happen? It comes about when newer languages that are better or appear cooler, start to emerge. The rise of Python has shifted many machine learning users from R to Python. The success of Julia has pushed performance-sensitive users to develop new mathematical libraries in this new language. Is R fading?\nThe programming landscape is evolving, and R, which has been around since 1995, isn’t the newest option available. To remain relevant any complex language depends on a large ecosystem of software elements that must be maintained and fixed regularly. R is certainly complex and it has many dependencies. It relies on a core group of developers who are allowed to make changes in the key parts of the language. These developers, while, on average, being significantly younger than Joe Biden, are not getting younger.\nMy work focuses on trying to modernize R. I’ve been examining R from a computer science perspective for about a decade, focusing on software components such as just-in-time compilers. My group is currently in the midst of writing our third attempt at writing a compiler for R. This effort led me to bring my collaborator, Tomas Kalibera, into the R community through our projects, which sparked his desire to assist the community. This was all part of a natural extension of our research. The goal of the MaintainR project is to maintain key parts of the R environment, which are challenging for volunteers to sustain. We have not found companies willing to contribute top-notch software engineers for this maintenance effort for their own reasons—perhaps they don’t have the resources, or they’re occupied with other tasks. Thus, our effort is focused on providing the necessary maintenance to prolong R’s usefulness.\nThe R ecosystem is dependent on the R interpreter, the core libraries, and CRAN. Which takes the most effort to maintain and why?\nEverything in this project is challenging because the components vary greatly in size and heterogeneity. The interpreter is the smallest part, which everyone relies on. Then, there’s the core library, which is about ten times larger than the interpreter and is a mix of R, C, and Fortran. Fortran isn’t as popular as it used to be, and we encounter issues when compiling it with modern compilers like LLVM. Ensuring Fortran compiles across all desired architectures and operating systems has been a persistent challenge.\nWe’ve also had difficulties integrating patches into LLVM and GCC for this purpose. Changes in these compilers can lead to breakages in our environment. The crown packages contain vast code—potentially 100 times more than the core library. This creates an inverted pyramid scenario where the amount of code increases as you move up the structure.\nMaintaining these packages is not our direct responsibility, but we can’t ignore them. Some are crucial for the users’ satisfaction. Some packages inevitably break as the language evolves and new versions are released. Tomas often has to approach maintainers to inform them of these issues. Sometimes, they respond and agree to implement fixes, but not always. Even when a technical fix might take just half a day, it can require a full week of negotiation with a developer to accept the patch.\nThis social aspect of software maintenance is significant and often the most challenging part. Developers have their own priorities, and a patch that doesn’t align with their goals can be seen as disruptive. Sometimes, the delay is simply because they are slow to respond. This complex interplay of technical and social challenges is a constant part of our efforts to keep the project moving forward.\nTomas Kalibera, a member of the core R team and supported as part of the MaintainR project, has implemented CheckR, a software tool for verification of the C code linked against the R interpreter. Can you explain how CheckR improves the R ecosystem and the overall quality of packages available to R users?\nMy team developed a tool called CheckR, which addresses issues arising from libraries written with a substantial amount of C code. The aim is to identify potentially misbehaving C that could cause unpredictable crashes, leading end users to mistakenly believe that R itself is faulty when, in fact, the issue may stem from a poorly written library or careless usage.\nCheckR processes the C code, transforms it, and an analyzer identifies points where things might go wrong. A common issue it detects involves what we call “Protect bugs.” This happens when the R code sends a value down to C, and C must “protect” this value to prevent it from being reclaimed by the garbage collector. Sometimes, developers handle this in a hasty and imprecise manner. If they make an error, the value given to C can be reclaimed and reused, leading to memory corruption—this could result in security flaws or crashes.\nCheckR is a static analyzer that flags potential issues but is not always definitive. It identifies possible problems, and we return to the developers to discuss whether these should be fixed. Often, developers are skeptical about the identified issues, which can lead to extended discussions. Sometimes, these issues might never occur, but often they do, and since CheckR is used daily across our entire codebase, it automatically generates reports that help us address these vulnerabilities. The next steps with this tool aren’t always clear-cut because we can’t predict all potential issues. For example, one persistent challenge has been how the Windows operating system encodes Unicode characters, requiring months of troubleshooting. Could we have foreseen this particular issue? Not really. It’s part of the unpredictable nature of software development, where new problems can emerge at any time.\nHave you been successful in extending the life of R by having CheckR run daily and helping with the interpreter, libraries, and CRAN?\nThousands of changes have been made to the R environment over time, and while I’d like to say that these changes have definitely improved things, as a scientist, I feel the need to provide concrete evidence, which I can’t always do. However, I can confidently say that each time we identify and fix a bug, the system has one less problem. The challenge, though, is that the potential for bugs can be virtually unlimited because new code is continually being added. It’s an ongoing process, and realistically, there might never be a point where we can declare it completely done.\nHow has it been working with the R Consortium? Would you recommend applying for an ISC grant to other R developers?\nIn our case, a lot of the work we do isn’t glamorous, and most volunteers are drawn to projects where they can attach their names to something flashy. Yet, there’s a continuous stream of necessary tasks that aren’t as appealing but are essential. Without a steady source of funding, sustaining efforts like ours would be impossible. The process we follow is streamlined, the community is welcoming, and your contributions can significantly impact a large user base.\nThe key message here is that funding is incredibly beneficial, especially for supporting those who contribute more gradually; the return on this investment is significant. For instance, in our project, without the funding, we couldn’t have supported the work of Tomas Kalibera, and nothing would have progressed. No company was willing to employ someone full-time for this, despite it being a crucial component of the ecosystem. Being able to provide funding allows us to engage someone who might otherwise have to spend their time on other activities and only contribute to this project in their spare time. Having someone fully dedicated for even a limited period is a tremendous advantage.\n\nAbout ISC Funded Projects\nA major goal of the R Consortium is to strengthen and improve the infrastructure supporting the R Ecosystem. We seek to accomplish this by funding projects that will improve both technical infrastructure and social infrastructure.\nLearn more"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Gergely Daróczi, the founder and organizer of the Budapest Users of R Network, updated the R Consortium about the group’s recent activities. Last year, Gergely discussed the group’s inception, and the challenges faced by the group during the pandemic. The group has now resumed in-person meetings, followed by networking sessions. The recent events organized by the group have focused on bioinformatics, large language models, and mathematical modeling.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI have a background in social sciences, and it was during one of my university classes 20 years ago that I was introduced to the R language. We had to use R to run simulations related to the chaotic behavior of the Hungarian potato market. I found R more enjoyable and versatile than other GUI tools like IBM’s SPSS and started using it for other projects as well. Later, I even developed some additional packages for R.\nI have been working with R for almost 20 years now. Despite my academic background in social sciences, I have worked in various industries, such as ad tech, fintech, and health tech, for the past 10 years.\nIn 2013, I attended my first useR! conference in Albacete, Spain, and it was a great experience to meet fellow R users from around the world. At the conference, I met Szilard Pafka, a Hungarian living in LA and organizer of the Los Angeles R User group. He suggested that I start an R User group in Hungary. After returning home, I decided to give it a shot, and we held our first meeting at the end of the summer of 2013. In a university room, it felt like there were only a dozen R users from academia. However, a lot has changed since then, as we now have almost 2,000 members in the local R User group, which exceeded my original expectations for such a small country like Hungary. It has been an interesting and great experience.\nIn Hungary, the community’s growth began slowly, with only 20 to 30 members in the first few years. However, it gradually increased over time. The community also hosted some famous personalities such as Romain Francois, Matt Dowle, and Hadley Wickham, which further accelerated its growth. Additionally, the community organized the first satRday and second ERUM conference, which provided a platform for networking and knowledge sharing, further strengthening the community.\nHow has the group been doing since our last conversation?\nAfter COVID, restarting the meetups was very challenging. We didn’t organize any virtual events because the main benefit of meetups was meeting in person, having face-to-face conversations, and getting to know each other. Therefore, we waited until the quarantine was over and it was safe to meet in person. We started slowly, organizing only two events per year with around 30 to 70 attendees, which was much lower than before COVID-19. However, it has been great to reconnect with old friends and make new ones.\nRecently, we have been focusing on bioinformatics and I was introduced to a local company that offered help with reaching out to speakers. Speakers drive these community meetings by bringing in a topic for discussion and talk, which we continue to discuss later on. Our past few events have focused on life sciences and have followed a lightning talk format, where we had around five 15-minute talks at each event. The topics were diverse, covering life sciences, some with LLMs involved, others focused on highly advanced math for modeling. We also had shiny applications that showed the biodiversity of forests in Hungary and some open-source tools besides R.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event?\nI can only offer subjective experiences on the matter, but I have witnessed the success of both virtual and in-person communities. However, our focus is on providing an exceptional in-person experience. To achieve this, we search for a central venue that is easily accessible for most of our members. This can be challenging, even in Hungary, a small country, as it can be difficult for members from other cities to travel to the capital for meetups. Nevertheless, we do our best to find a central venue, such as a university or an industry partner who can offer a space for talks and a networking opportunity afterward.\nIt is important to have a room with plenty of chairs and a larger area for people to gather after the talks. We can provide soft drinks, beer, or wine along with some pizzas and have a chat for an hour or two after the talk. The venue is a crucial factor. It’s also important to have speakers who are interested in the community so that they will come to learn as well. It’s great to have speakers with interesting topics, but the most important thing for me is networking. After the talks, coming together and getting to know others, learning about their struggles, and maybe sharing some tips in person with each other, becoming friends, or learning about opportunities in other industries. Networking and facilitating connections are crucial tasks for R user group organizers.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language?\nFive years ago, machine learning models were a hot topic, and everyone discussed different implementations of GBM. However, things have changed, and nowadays, large language models (LLM) rule over all the topics. LLMs are often implemented in languages other than R, making it difficult to train them from R. Despite this, there are still many use cases for LLMs, even in life sciences and health tech. However, caution must be taken when using AI and LLMs in these fields. Recently, at two bioinformatics events, some nice use cases of LLMs were shared with the audience. This has attracted new members interested in learning how to use AI or LLMs, which can be as simple as doing some API integrations in R, such as calling the chatGPT API to generate text or images.\nI’m excited that COVID restrictions are easing up and meetups are returning to normal. I can’t wait for the first in-person useR! conference in Salzburg in a few months. I highly recommend that anyone who can travel to Salzburg in July join us. The city has excellent train connections to European cities, so I hope many people from Europe can make it. I’m looking forward to attending an in-person useR! conference again.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nCurrently, I’m focusing on the ETL pipeline of the Spare Cores project, collecting information on cloud compute resources, which will soon have the R bindings as well. In the past, I’ve been working on R packages related to reporting (e.g. “pander”) and using R in production (e.g. “logger,” “dbr” or “boto3”). Recently, I enjoyed integrating APIs and frameworks from other programming languages, such as Python (kudos to the reticulate team!), in R."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium recently connected with Kylie Bemis, assistant teaching professor at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. She has a keen interest in statistical computing frameworks and techniques for analyzing intricate data, particularly focusing on datasets with complex correlation patterns or those that amalgamate data from various origins.\nKylie created matter, an R package that offers adaptable data structures suitable for in-memory computing on both dense and sparse arrays, incorporating multiple features tailored for processing nonuniform signals, including mass spectra and various other types of spectral data. Recently, Kylie upgraded matter to version 2.4. Since our May 2023 discussion, Kylie has enhanced its signal processing capabilities, focusing on analytical tools like principal component analysis and dimension reduction algorithms, which are crucial for imaging and spectral data. A grant from the R Consortium supports this project.\nWe talked with you about matter in May 2023. You were providing support for matter and looking to improve the handling of larger data sets and sparse non-uniform signals. matter has been updated to version 2.4. What’s new?\nLast time we spoke, I had already rewritten most of the matter infrastructure in C++ for better maintainability. Since then, my focus has been on enhancing our signal processing capabilities. This summer, I’ve been adding essential signal processing functions and basic analytical tools, which are particularly useful in fields dealing with spectra or various types of signals.\nI’ve incorporated fundamental techniques like principal component analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and partial least squares. I’ve also added several dimension reduction algorithms and a range of signal processing tools for both 1D and 2D signals. This includes smoothing algorithms for images and 1D signals and warping tools applicable to both.\nThese enhancements are crucial for working with imaging and spectral data and include features like distance calculation and nearest neighbor search.\nMy aim has been to augment matter with robust signal processing tools, particularly for sparse and non-uniform signals. This is inspired by my experience in augmented reality (AR) and my desire to integrate tools similar to MATLAB’s Signal Processing Toolbox or SciPy in Python. As someone primarily analyzing mass spectrometry imaging data, I found these tools initially in my Cardinal package. I wanted to transfer them to a more appropriate platform, not specific to mass imaging, and reduce Cardinal’s reliance on compiled native code for easier version updates.\nAdditionally, I’ve been building a more robust testing infrastructure for these tools and documenting them thoroughly, including citations for the algorithms I used for key picking and smoothing techniques. This documentation details the implementation of various algorithms, such as guided filtering and nonlinear diffusion smoothing, citing the sources of these algorithms.\nBy providing support for non-uniform signal data, matter provides a back end to mass spectrometry imaging data. But working with large files is applicable in a lot of domains. What are some examples?\nI deal with large files and data sets across various fields. Matter can be particularly impactful in areas dealing with signal, spectral, or imaging data. One field that comes to mind is remote sensing, where the imaging tools I’ve incorporated would be highly beneficial. That’s one key application area.\nAnother field is biomedical imaging, especially MRI data. For instance, a data format we often use for mass spectrometry imaging was originally developed for MRI – it’s called Analyze, and there’s a more recent variant known as NIfTI. This format is also supported in Cardinal for mass spec imaging data, but it’s primarily used in MRI and fMRI data analysis. While matter doesn’t directly offer plug-and-play functionality for MRI data, with some modifications, it could certainly be adapted for importing and processing MRI data stored in these formats.\nWe don’t have a specific function to read NIfTI files directly, but the structure of these files is quite similar to the mass imaging files we commonly work with. They consist of a binary file organized in a particular format, with a header that functions like a C or C++ struct, indicating where different image slices are stored. Understanding and interpreting this header, which is well-documented elsewhere, is key.\nSo, with some effort to read and attach the header file correctly, it’s entirely feasible to build a function for reading and importing MRI data. We’ve already done something similar with the Analyze format. Someone could definitely examine our approach and develop a method to handle MRI data effectively.\nPreviously, you indicated you wanted to improve R data frames and string support. You have a prototype data frame in the package already? What’s the schedule for improvements?\nI’m currently evaluating how far we’ll expand certain features in our project. One of these features is supporting strings, which is already implemented. Regarding data frames, I believe there might be better solutions out there, but it’s quite simple to integrate our data with them. For instance, taking a vector or an array, whether a matter matrix or a matter vector, and inserting it into a data frame column works well, particularly with Bioconductor data frames.\nI’m not entirely convinced that developing standalone, specialized data frame support in matter is necessary. It seems that other platforms, especially those like Bioconductor, are already making significant advancements in this area. For now, it seems sufficient that users can easily incorporate a matter vector or array into a data frame column. I’m hesitant to duplicate efforts or create overlapping functionalities with what’s already being done in this field.\nWhat’s the best way for someone to try matter? How should someone get started?\nLike any Bioconductor package, we offer a vignette on the Bioconductor website. This vignette provides a basic guide on how to start using our package, including creating matrices and arrays. It shows how these can serve as building blocks to construct larger matrices, arrays, and vectors. This is a straightforward way for users to begin.\nRegarding the applicability of our package, it really depends on the specific data needs of the user. For instance, our package provides out-of-memory matrices and arrays. If that’s the primary requirement, then our package is certainly suitable. However, there are other packages, both in Bioconductor, like HDF5 array support, and on CRAN, such as big memory and FF, that also offer similar functionalities.\nThe real advantage of our package becomes apparent when dealing with specific data types. If you’re working with data formats like MRI, where you have a binary file and a clear understanding of its format, our package can be very helpful. It simplifies attaching different parts of the file to an R data structure.\nMoreover, if your work involves signal data, particularly non-uniform signals like those in mass spectrometry or imaging data, our package becomes even more beneficial. Over the summer, I’ve added extensive support for preprocessing, dimension reduction, and other processes that are crucial for handling these types of data. So, in these scenarios, our package can be a valuable tool.\nAnything else you would like to share about matter 2.0?\nI’ve spent much of the summer working on improvements to the matter package, and it’s now in a good place, particularly regarding signal processing capabilities. These enhancements are largely aligned with the needs of mass spectrometry, an area I closely focus on. As new requirements emerge in mass spectrometry, I’ll look to add relevant features to matter, particularly in signal and image processing.\nHowever, my current priority is updating the Cardinal package to support all these recent changes in matter. Ensuring that Cardinal is fully compatible with the new functionalities in matter is my next major goal, and I’m eager to get started on this as soon as possible."

Although I am officially in charge, this is a collaborative effort between all of us who are present in this meeting, along with some others who couldn’t join. I work in Research IT and mainly use R for projects assigned to me by other people.\nAnthony: My name is Anthony and I work at Research IT with Martin at the University of Manchester. I first came into contact with R when I was a student. Later, I became a helper at many of the university’s R training courses based on the Carpentries training courses. Camila, who was Martin’s predecessor, was also a trainer at R and she formed the R Users Manchester group. I volunteered to help her with the group a year ago, and it just turned a year old. After that, I continued to be a part of the group.\nLana: Hi there, my name is Lana. I am a PhD student and research assistant at the Division of Psychology and Mental Health at the University of Manchester. I have been using R for the past six years, ever since my Master’s degree. I have been a part of the group since its inception and have been running R introduction sessions for beginners within my division for a couple of years now. When I learned the group was being formed, I contacted Camila a year ago. This makes us founding members of the group.\nRowan: Hello, my name is Rowan Green. I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. For my research work, I use R extensively for simulation modeling bacteria, analyzing lab data, and creating visualizations. The best thing about using R is that it produces much prettier visualizations than other options available to us as biologists. We have a lot of master’s and undergraduate students coming through the lab. I often give them pre-written scripts they can tweak to create their plots. It’s exciting to see them working hard to produce their plots.\nCamilla mentioned starting a group to share knowledge about R on a university-wide level. I found this a great opportunity to participate and learn from others’ presentations during the meetings. It has been an enriching experience so far.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Manchester?\nAnthony: In industries such as banking and finance, R is frequently used to create graphs to showcase econometric data in an easy-to-understand manner. The graphical capabilities of this programming language make it a popular choice in these fields. The university we’re in has access to the Financial Times, which is known for producing visually stunning graphs. Interestingly, they also use an R package called FT plot tools, which is a specialized package solely for their use. So, it’s safe to say that R has a significant presence in the banking and finance sectors.\nAre your meetups virtual or in-person? What topics have you covered recently? What are your plans for the group in the future?\nMartin: Our events are a mix of in-person and online meetings. There have been talks about developing packages, data visualization, automating reports, and working with tables. We usually cover topics we are confident about or know people from the university are working on. However, we are also trying to get external speakers to come and talk. It’s challenging, but we are doing our best to make it happen. We are currently accepting proposals from potential speakers.\nOur book club has mostly or completely taken place online.\nLana:  Bookclub was mostly online. During the summer book club, we were reading R for Data Science. We covered a chapter or two chapters each time. We had the book’s second edition, and people from all over the university joined the club.\nWe were discussing the possibility of changing the format of Tidy Tuesdays. We received feedback that people don’t have enough time to come up with something extra creative every month. Additionally, there has been a need for more practice. Therefore, we plan to redesign Tidy Tuesdays to be more practice-oriented than creativity-oriented. We will be implementing these changes this year.\nAnthony: We’ve recently had several discussions on useful packages, particularly in R. Some packages that were developed and published were custom-made. We also had presentations on the cosinor and cosinor2 packages, which are used for fitting curves, and an R update package for validating clinical prediction models.\nThere are two other R groups in Manchester. Our aim for this year is to establish communication with them and collaborate in a coordinated manner. (Editor’s Note: We recently talked with the Manchester R User Group.) Currently, our group solely focuses on the internal R community at the University of Manchester.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event?\nRowan: I’m not sure if everyone would agree with me, but I think we did well in the format of our meetings. We started with brief, brief talks – within an hour – followed by questions and discussions, which worked well.\nHowever, the harder part has been promoting and informing people about the meetings. Sometimes, word of mouth has been more effective than emails and posters. I noticed that they were interested in attending when I encouraged my lab group, who all use R. But without any scheduled reminders and someone to encourage them, it may be difficult to get people to come.\nLana: It’s important to identify everyone’s strengths or specialties within the organizing group, as they will probably be useful in the first few events. After that, you can expand your network within the community, which is easy to do since people are easily reachable. This will allow you to find interesting topic ideas and strengths to draw from.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language?\nMartin: I’ve noticed a growing interest in Shiny lately, as I manage a pilot server for the university and have seen an increase in users over time. There have also been several inquiries about using R within our high-performance computer cluster, which may be something we can offer to the university. This interest is not surprising, given the current hype around machine learning.\nA trending area that applies to multiple platforms, not just R, is towards reproducible research and compatibility between different programming languages. This means that R can be integrated with Python and other languages to create a documented and integrated pipeline. I’ve been experimenting with SnakeMake, which works well with R, but it would be great to see more integration from the R side, perhaps through the common workflow language or another similar tool.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nRowen: Recently, I wrote a preprint of a paper where we simulated the growth and mutation of bacteria using differential equations and R programming language. To perform the simulation, we utilized high-performance computing, which enabled us to simulate various ways the bacteria could grow by adjusting the rates of reactions occurring within the cells. This simulation required high-performance computing to be feasible for running multiple simulations.\nAfter running simulations, we came up with some ideas to test in the lab. Our focus was on measuring mutation rates, and we used statistical analysis to estimate them through R. We have been striving to ensure reproducibility, and as a result, we have annotated all the data tables and R scripts with the paper.\nIt has been an interesting journey for me. I had to tidy up my messy scripts and think about how someone else would perceive them. I had to ensure they made sense. However, the project was fascinating as I generated hypotheses using R, tested them, and analyzed and visualized them with the same tool. R is a complete tool that can handle all aspects of the process, making it a brilliant choice."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium recently interviewed Eli Eydlin, a dedicated member of the R community who has been instrumental in establishing an R User Group in Haifa, Israel. With a background in physics and a recent shift into the biotech industry, Eli was motivated to create the group after noticing the absence of a local R community in his new city. Despite Haifa’s relatively small size, it boasts a diverse R community, including professionals from high-tech companies, academia, and startups. Eli shared his experience organizing their first Meetup, which featured speakers from vastly different backgrounds, and his plans to make future events more inclusive. His story highlights the importance of community building and the impact of taking the initiative, offering inspiration for others looking to contribute to their local R communities.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI’ve been working in a biotech startup for nearly two years. My background is more on the pharma side, but I decided to dive into this new field. When I moved, I noticed that there wasn’t an R User Group in the area, even though I knew of other groups in different cities and countries that were doing great things. I didn’t like the idea of not having one here, so I decided to start one myself. We just had our first event, and I’m really excited to be a part of this initiative.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Haifa?\nOne of the reasons I started this was to meet new people who are also R programmers or users. I already know that the community is really diverse. My city isn’t huge—around 300,000 people—but has much to offer. There are big high-tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon here that support their R&D departments, and I’m certain that some of our members are involved. Like in many places in Israel, there are hundreds of small startups. What I find interesting is that people come from all sorts of backgrounds—mostly from academia, as usual, but now also from government, traditional companies, and small businesses. I’m excited to see where this leads.\nYou had a Meetup on August 6th, 2024. Can you share more about the topic covered? Why this topic?\nWe have two completely different topics and two amazing speakers. Sofia Nazarova is a marine biologist at Israel Oceanographic & Limnological, who also organizes private guided tours. She teaches people about plants and animals, so she’s not a programmer. However, she co-authored the first-ever R textbook published in Russian, which makes her experience unique. Typically, I work with people who are programmers or data scientists, but she’s out there in the field, literally working with marine life.\nOur second speaker was Adi Sarid, the CEO of Sarid Institute LTD, a data science company focusing on production and consumption. He’s also writing a book on R, this time in Hebrew. It’s a completely different experience—he’s a business leader working with governments and large firms, and he showcased some fantastic examples of practical applications in his talk.\nI deliberately chose speakers with very different backgrounds because that interests me. While organizing the group, I thought about what I wanted to learn and the connections I wanted to make.\nWho was the target audience for attending this event?\nTo be honest, there wasn’t a specific target audience for this event because I didn’t know anyone. I just tried to reach out to whoever might be interested in participating. After the first event, I noticed a big jump in interest, but only one woman attended. So, for the next event, I want to specifically target women and try to figure out what went wrong. It seems like many women are using R, but for some reason, they didn’t show up. We’ll address that and improve things moving forward.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nWe didn’t use anything for the first event, which we may do with the future in mind. We wanted to stay connected, especially since we’re in Israel, and it’s important to support each other under pressure. The event went well, but after it was over, I started receiving messages from people saying they couldn’t attend because they needed to spend time with their kids or were afraid of potential security issues.\nI realize how important it is to offer in-person meetings, but I now acknowledge that it’s not feasible for everyone. So, for the next event, we’ll make it easier for people to join remotely, perhaps through Zoom or a similar platform. We’ll also hold events in more secure locations. It’s clear that while in-person events are valuable, they aren’t always possible or suitable for everyone.\nWe would like to get to know you more personally. Can you please tell me about yourself? For example, hobbies/interests or anything you want to share about yourself.\nFirst of all, I have a physics background and a master’s degree in it. I recently transitioned into the pharma and biotech industry, which has been a new and exciting challenge for me. My interests have always been diverse, and I’m particularly fascinated by this field, as well as by the natural beauty of Israel, especially its trees. On a different note, I’m also a harmonica player, which is another passion of mine.\nPlease share any additional details you would like included in the blog.\nI want to take the initiative with the R Consortium and contribute to its efforts. I see how cool and relatively easy it is to organize such a group. Focusing on developing countries is important, but it’s also relevant here in Israel, even though we’re relatively wealthy. What motivated me was seeing others take action, and I realized that I needed to step up and organize a group as well. The tools and support provided by the R Consortium are incredibly helpful for bringing people together. So, I just wanted to say thank you for that."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Umar Isah Adam, the founder and organizer of the R User Group Kano, Nigeria, spoke with the R Consortium during the pandemic about his efforts to engage the next generation of students in the R community. Recently, the R Consortium followed up with Umar to discuss the group’s progress over the past few years. He discussed the increasing acceptance and interest in R within academia. The user group is working with various colleges in Kano state to introduce R to students and teach them the fundamentals. Umar also shared his experience using R for managerial tasks related to student data. He hopes to persuade college management to use R for data handling instead of the current manual processes.\nPlease share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nMy name is Umar Isah Adam, and I’m from Kano State, Nigeria. I studied mathematics at the Federal University Dutse, Jigawa State. During my studies, I became interested in statistics and technology. One of my lecturers mentioned R as a statistical analysis tool, which piqued my interest. I learned it by researching online and watching videos. Later, a friend introduced me to R User Groups. I found that I was interested in R and noticed there wasn’t a group in Kano State, so I applied to start a chapter there, and it was approved.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Kano, Nigeria?\nThe use of R is relatively new in Kano State. Most academics in the area use SPSS in their work. It makes it challenging for R to gain traction in this environment. Despite the challenges, we have been making progress with the support of our user group. Currently, I work as an assistant lecturer at a college in Kano State. I recently organized a well-attended seminar for lecturers and students at the Kano State College of Education and Preliminary Studies. I also posted a video of the workshop on YouTube and have received requests for more information.\nThere’s room for improvement. We’ve received requests from academic institutions to host events or provide information about the power of R. However, we cannot do so now due to the nature of my work and inadequate funding. However, we plan to start a 10-week training session soon. It will likely be free, as we are collaborating with the Kano State College of Education and Preliminary Studies to organize it. R isn’t very popular here, and more than 70% of academicians need help understanding what it is and how to use it effectively. However, those introduced to it have shown a high interest in learning and utilizing it.\nWe aim to introduce R to the academic community, and after this, we plan to move on to another college and launch a new program. In summary, R is not widely known in our society, but we are progressing. There has been an increase in the acceptance of R and a growing interest from different people in academia, particularly in R. Many are interested. Still, there needs to be more awareness about it. Most people need to learn what R is and how to use it. Therefore, most of our upcoming programs will focus on introducing the R language.\nAdditionally, there is an issue with student access. Most of our students don’t have personal computers and can only access them on campus, usually at the ICT department. This lack of access also affects student engagement. However, among academics and lecturers in our colleges, there is growing interest in R.\nDo you host in-person or online events? How do you make your events inclusive?\nIt’s important to remember that online events became essential during the pandemic. However, due to internet connectivity issues, we avoid online meetings or events most of the time. As a result, our sessions are usually held offline. We have been hosting events within colleges and other institutions to make them easily accessible to students and academics. It is also more cost-effective and popular than hosting in private locations. Advertising these events has proven effective, as interested individuals are usually willing to attend when they see the advertisement.\nWe attempted to transfer between colleges, such as those owned by the state government. The majority of the data and processes are research-based. Therefore, we strive to incorporate more R programming aligned with academic requirements. We aim to limit topics to the use of R in academia to ensure that attendees feel more connected and can see the practical applications of using R. For instance, compared to using SPSS, where one often needs to use code or convert data into another format, with R, one can easily import data into the working environment and manipulate it as needed.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on using the R language. What is the goal/reason, result, or anything interesting, especially related to your industry?\nI usually demonstrate to people around me, including the school management, how easy it is to use R. For example, we need help with the examination office potentially losing some of their data. However, they have a backup on an external drive. I am importing the data from the old template to the new one in Excel format. I am also working on calculating the student results and offloading them into the new portal we have developed. Doing this job manually might take a month, but if I successfully create this program, it will complete the job in two to three days. It will demonstrate to the school management the importance and impact of using R.\nI am proposing to the college management to introduce a certified course of study on “Introduction to R” within the ICT department. Showcasing how this programming language can impact the working environment will help them understand the need for this course. Many students rely on fundamental analyses using questionnaires, frequency, and percentage without exploring visualization techniques. As a supervisor, I encourage using R for data analysis in student projects, as it provides a more comprehensive approach. However, many students need access to computers. Therefore, by offering this course, we can equip them with valuable skills and knowledge to benefit their future careers."

I work as a data scientist at a US-based private firm and have a post-graduate degree in statistics from the University of Calcutta. I have been using R since my post-graduate days in 2018 and used it extensively in various projects during my studies. Since 2022, I have also been an R instructor for a non-profit organization. Additionally, I have been involved in several short projects working with R. Since April 2024, I have managed the Kolkata R User group.\nThis is the third city-based R user group in India that is affiliated with the R Consortium. I plan to arrange virtual meetups monthly and in-person meetups annually. I enjoy helping and teaching people from diverse backgrounds, not only in statistics, mathematics, and data science but also in other areas. I want to teach them to use R language to add value to their professional and personal projects.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Kolkata?\nThe Kolkata User Group has been formed with a broader perspective that I would like to share with you. Kolkata is known for its reputation in statistical research and education. The city is recognized as the birthplace of modern statistics in India, with the establishment of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in 1931 by a prominent figure in statistics. The University of Calcutta, where I graduated, was the first in Asia to offer a post-graduate degree in statistics in 1941. This rich history made the formation of the Kolkata R User Group inevitable. Our community consists of academics and professionals from diverse fields such as life sciences, healthcare, the public sector, physics, astrophysics, and other industries. This diverse background facilitates robust exchanges of ideas and techniques related to R and data, making our R community in Kolkata truly unique.\nPlease tell us about your recent and upcoming events?\nI would like to highlight a recent event. Last month, in June, we had our inaugural session where we introduced Quarto, a recently released reporting tool by Posit. Our goal was to make the participants aware of this tool and its outstanding features, such as website building, ebook writing, creating thesis papers, manuscripts, and blogging sites. We aimed to show participants, including early graduate students, professionals in the industry, and researchers from academia, that they can use Quarto in their projects and studies for reporting. This was our first organized session.\nThe upcoming session is scheduled for July 13th. It will focus on a new approach to teaching R to students with non-technical backgrounds such as business students. Dr. Abhimanyu Gupta from Saint Louis University will be the speaker at this event.\nWe have received very positive feedback and responses from the participants who are showing interest in the upcoming events. They want us to organize such events frequently. People are very much aware of these events and this community. They are very responsive, and we have received positive responses. Two esteemed Economics professors have expressed interest in joining our organizing team and working with us.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nCurrently, I am working on two projects. The first project involves cricket analytics, where I extensively use R for cleaning up messy raw data and conducting exploratory data analysis at both the team and individual player levels and published a shiny dashboard on performance analysis of T20I players. I’m also building a statistical model to predict the total score of an innings, the winner of the match, and the tournament. Lastly, I aim to compile all the findings into an ebook format.\nCricket Performance Analysis Shiny Dashboard\nThe second project revolves around converting the functions and features of AstroPy, an open source software package for astronomy and astrophysics, into R. Our goal is to enhance its popularity among researchers and scientists in the astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology domains. I am collaborating with another individual from a physics background on this open source project, and we plan to publish it on GitHub soon for public access."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Keith Karani Wachira, the Dekut R Communityorganizer based in Nyeri, Kenya, was recently interviewed by the R Consortium and shared his journey in the R community, which began in 2019 during his university years. Sparked by a tech meetup, Keith’s interest grew through the pandemic sessions. Now in academia, he uses R to address business automation challenges, attracting industry professionals to his practical sessions. Excited by trends like AI integration and tools like Quarto, Keith foresees increased automation and efficiency. Outside work, he enjoys baseball, graphic design, web development, and teaching R, finding great reward in his students’ success.\nPlease share about your background and your involvement in the R Community. What is your level of experience with the R language?\nI began my journey with R in early 2019 while studying at university. In May 2019, I learned about a tech community through a friend who posted in one of our school’s WhatsApp groups, inviting us to join a meetup. Curious, I decided to attend.\nI remember the meetup was on a Saturday, and it turned out to be the launch of a new club. My friend invited me and was part of the Microsoft Learn Students’ Ambassadors. His classmates used R for their engineering projects, which sparked my interest.\nDuring the first lesson, I found it challenging as there were about 30 students, most of whom were first-year students pursuing various degrees, including Business Information Technology, which I was majoring in, along with a minor in Communication. My first programming language that year was C, which I found interesting.\nOver time, I found the R language interesting, especially its syntax. What fascinated me the most was how data could be used to create visualizations. This curiosity led me to explore data from my local sewerage and water company, using R to create informative visualizations and derive insights that can be used in decision making.\nI continued attending the sessions in 2020 during the pandemic. Although we no longer had in-person classes, we adapted using Microsoft Teams for our meetings. Eric organized the meetups and arranged tech talks with speakers from Posit (formerly RStudio) and NairobiR. I remember attending these sessions and understanding how powerful R is.\nThroughout 2020, I attended regularly but still lacked confidence in the language. However, in 2022, I made significant progress. Under Eric’s leadership, we expanded the community to involve more people, especially students from the department of Actuarial Science, Telecommunication Engineering and electrical engineering. We set up a structured learning environment based on materials from Hadley Wickham’s books and resources from the R website and blogs.\nEric’s leadership greatly influenced me. He taught us how to write blogs using Markdown and publish on RPubs. This is a bit about my background. Today, we continue to teach R, following a structured approach to help others intermediate in using the language.\nWhat industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?\nI’m currently in academia, primarily focusing on various technical challenges. We hold sessions where we demonstrate the use of R in robotics for members in Electrical Engineering and Telecommunication Engineering. For those in Actuarial Science, we show how to create time series models using R.\nComing from a background in business and information technology, I focus on solving business challenges, particularly automating business processes and addressing issues in banking, logistics, retail using opensource datasets. Our efforts are not limited to academia; we concentrate on applying R across different disciplines within academia to tackle these challenges.\nWhy do industry professionals come to your user group? What is the benefit of attending?\nAn interesting scenario arose when I became interested in EMS (Engineering and Management Systems). We started organizing hybrid sessions after the COVID period and it caught interest of students from another university in Kenya ,Egerton University. Through, statistical analysis bureau of Egerton University they joined our sessions to learn how to leverage tidy models packages to create machine learning models and also collaborate with the community members.\nThey were very interested, and as future economists, we demonstrated how to build and appreciate these models. In previous meetups, we also introduced participants to Shiny apps, teaching them how to host their models and create interfaces to display their work.\nAnother valuable skill we taught was generating reports using R Markdown. This allows users to write code, format text, add videos, images, and emojis, and present their work in a professional and engaging manner. Attendees found this particularly useful as it enhanced their ability to write, structure, and report code effectively.\nParticipants learned to leverage the R ecosystem for coding, structuring their work, and reporting their findings by attending our sessions.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nA trend I’ve noticed is the widespread effort to include everyone in learning programming languages like R. This is evident in the emergence of specialized groups such as R for Medicine and R for Pharma. Two of our alumni even demonstrated how R can be used in robotics through a talk at Posit Conference 2022, demonstrating its applicability in specific industries. This specialization fascinates me, and I am eager to see how R will be used across various fields.\nAnother trend is using tools like Quarto, which facilitates the implementation of such specializations. Additionally, I am excited about the incorporation of AI in building R applications, such as using Gemini for Shiny apps. Although materials on this are currently limited, I see this as a growing trend.\nThe integration of AI will likely lead to the automation of many manual processes, further enhancing R’s utility and efficiency in various industries.\nWe would like to get to know you more personally. Can you please tell me about yourself? For example, your hobbies/interests or anything else you want to share.\nWhen not in front of my laptop, I enjoy playing baseball and softball, especially as a catcher. Catching allows me to see the entire game command the play, and I enjoy throwing the ball from home to second base and picking off a runner. It’s a challenging position that helps me focus and improve my aim.\nOn the side, I also do some graphic design using Canva which I use to create posters and newsletters for our community meetups. Additionally, I have web development skills using MERN stack.\nAnother passion of mine is teaching R to others. I love seeing people learn and apply the concepts and then go on to teach others. One of my students from his first year has now taken over as a lead in our community, which is incredibly encouraging. He even competed in hackathons and finished fourth, showing how much he has grown.\nTeaching and seeing others succeed is something I find very rewarding and motivating."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Marcela Victoria Soto, co-organizer of the R4HR -Club de R para RRHH, Buenos Aires, Argentina, recently updated the R Consortium about the group’s recent activities. Last year, Sergio García Mora, the group’s founder, discussed the adoption and expansion of R in human resources in Argentina. Marcela emphasized the importance of data analysis for informed and agile decision-making for companies in Argentina. She also shared details of some of her budgeting, accounting, and annual income tax projects.\nR4HR is holding an online event called “Data Visualization in HR” on June 1, 2024, for Spanish-speaking R users. The meetup will be conducted via Google Meet.\nPlease share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI earned a bachelor’s degree in labor relations and received training as a labor relations teacher at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Additionally, I completed a postgraduate course in Human Resources Management from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA) and a Diploma in Computational Social Sciences from the National University of General San Martín (UNSAM). I also attended the Argentina Program at the University of Salta, completing all three program modules.\nWhat industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?\nI currently work in the textile industry as the Head of Human Resources. At Yagmour, I use R to present reports on employee turnover, salary reports, accounting entries, etc. Additionally, I use R to consolidate the annual Human Resources budget according to the company’s accounts.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Buenos Aires?\nThe R4HR community is a collaborative space comprising individuals interested in data and human resources. We hold various meetups within the community where projects, R packages, etc., are shared. It is a Spanish-speaking community. The R Club is a meeting space for professionals in the field, where we can share tools, new ways of addressing issues, and novel approaches to similar problems. People who attend and are familiar with R sometimes need to be made aware of everything this programming language offers for simple and complex issues—the benefit of attending lies in sharing and creating spaces for knowledge exchange.\nYou have a Meetup on “Data Visualization in HR” on June 1st, 2024. Can you share more about the topic covered? Why this topic?\nIn June, we will hold a meetup to address Data Visualization in HR using the ggplot2 package, adding interactivity and context with plotly. This topic is not just interesting but also highly practical. Visualization is a great way to interpret data and graphically identify behavior patterns, which can also prompt questions about the presented information. The plotly package can add insights that are not apparent in the graphs. Additionally, plotly allows for creating interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore and manipulate the charts directly within the visualization. It can include zooming, data selection, and more, providing a richer and more dynamic user experience.\nThis meetup’s target audience is individuals interested in understanding the benefits of working with R‌ and people in the human resources field who are interested in the topic.\nFor this event, we conducted the invitation through Meetup and provided a Google Meet link. After the event, we will upload it to YouTube and communicate to the community through social media.\nWould you like to tell us about an interesting recent Meetup from the group?\nI recently presented at a group event titled Annual Income Tax with R to showcase the various problems one can address using R beyond data visualization or analysis. In Argentina, to carry out this development, one must consider the guidelines provided by the Federal Administration of Public Revenues (AFIP), which, at the national level, determines the parameters to be used for presentations; payroll software interprets these parameters. Those who do not have a payroll system can use the development done in R to carry out this presentation.\nIn Argentina, the frequent changes and calculation methods have made everything related to this tax quite complex. They impose this tax on salaries that are considered high-value. It is a tax withheld by the company, and due to inflation and various modifications, the analysis and handling of this tax end up being one of the most complex issues for employees in the country. I made this process easier in this meetup by using R.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Are there any trends you see developing in the near future?\nTrends in R are about its growing popularity and its transformative impact. It allows more people to join and enhances its application to various problems. There is also ongoing work on clustering applied to Human Resources to understand how each group functions, their relationships, common characteristics, etc. In Argentina, due to the current economic situation, data analysis not only at the salary level but also at the soft skills level is an urgent necessity for companies aiming to use data for agile decision-making. Business data is vital for analyzing the rest of the decisions that need to be made by Human Resources and the entire company. To use data for agile decision-making, companies must consider salary levels, understand which soft skills are needed and what the context requires, and make decisions accordingly.\nA trend that will continue to develop in the future relates to Artificial Intelligence and how it complements everyday tasks or serves as a support tool.\nPlease share about a project you are working on or have worked on using the R language. What is the goal/reason, result, or anything interesting related to your industry?\nI have worked on several projects in R, starting with the basics related to data visualization of absenteeism, turnover, and salary analysis.\nSomething different that I worked on with R was creating the annual Income Tax presentation. The objective was to consolidate the yearly information of each employee covered by the regulations according to the parameters provided by the Federal Administration of Public Revenues. It required interpreting each requirement at the programming level. This file had to be submitted in TXT format, which meant working with rare extensions in Human Resources areas.\nAnother different project in R was creating accounting entries. It allows for systematizing a large amount of information and grouping it according to the accounts.\nI have also used R to prepare information presented to the Ministry of Labor, which required extensive cross-referencing. For example, it involved cross-referencing gender with absences, working hours, days, leaves, and paid leaves, among other variables. The complexity of this was the relationship between the data, where any incorrect data would ultimately lead to inconsistencies in the information.\nLastly, before applying R, the Budgeting process in our company involved transferring information across different Excel sheets, using pivot tables, and copying and pasting it into a summarized form. It took a significant amount of time, and whenever a variable needed to be changed, the entire process had to be redone, which implied errors due to the large amount of information transfer. Today, people work on this process dynamically in Excel and then process it in a script that consolidates all the information in minutes, sometimes less. It allows for the creation of multiple scenarios dynamically in a time of significant volatility and limited time. This process using R has achieved a substantial reduction in time, in addition to ensuring data consistency."

    "text": "Maria Prokofieva, organizer of the Business Analytics and R Business User Group, spoke to the R Consortium last year about the Adoption of R by the Actuaries Community in Melbourne. Recently, Maria updated the R Consortium on the group’s focus, which has shifted towards business consultancy. The group provides a platform for graduate students to gain valuable industry experience and mentorship through various projects. The group is committed to ethical data governance and inclusive community building and prioritizes these values in all its initiatives.\nPlease share about your background and your involvement in the R Community.\nMy name is Maria Prokofieva. I work as a Leading ML Engineer at Mitchell Institute at Victoria University. I lead a stack of projects that use data to inform strategy and policy development. I am also an academic at the university, conducting research and teaching courses on ML/AI and data analysis. Through my work, I have the privilege of collaborating with various organizations, governments, and scholars to assist them in utilizing data to make decisions that impact the lives of many. I love open source, and what we see today is amazing – the world is changing. I have been a member of R and Python communities for many years, and seeing us grow is great.\nHow has your R User Group been doing since the last time we spoke?\nThe group has been performing well. As we grow, we focus on projects and become extremely busy with them. We already have a small community of people involved in different projects who also work together and communicate regularly. Once a month, we organize meetups where we present master classes—we moved to an in-person space but occasionally do online events. Our group has two main directions: business consultancy and business knowledge exchange.\nWe have been quite successful in building connections with bigger and smaller businesses interested in doing more data analysis. Some smaller businesses have staff who can perform their duties, and this is where community members have been fantastic.\nThe backbone of my community comprises my current and former Master’s students, who completed a course on business analytics. They are passionate about using R in everyday tasks and already possess some knowledge and experience, which they are happy to share. They are also interested in building connections and networking for their future jobs. This platform provides a mutually beneficial relationship for new students who get valuable industry experience through unpaid volunteering. These students receive mentorship from business leaders and senior software developers who share their programming knowledge and their knowledge of business negotiations and working with clients through the entire project life cycle.\nWe have been successful in working with cloud services such as AWS. We are actively exploring ways to automate data science on AWS and have several upcoming workshops where we will dive deeper into this topic. One workshop will focus on AWS Bedrock, where we will introduce non-technical business community members to employing large language models to perform their tasks. Our workshops focus on addressing specific problem-solving tasks rather than just the environment. We look into the business problems and how they can be solved.\nIt’s better to identify a problem and brainstorm solutions than to focus on tools. It’s fascinating to see how the community comes up with unique solutions to the problem. This approach is exactly what we need today, where no single preferred tool exists. Even if we use R Studio, we can easily integrate Python and other environments to accomplish the task. The focus should always be on the task guiding the process rather than the tools themselves.\nAny recent project you have worked on using R?\nOur recent project is based on utilising AWS Bedrock and GPT-4 to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for a business. This system streamlines customer email communication using internal documents and company FAQs to auto-generate tailored responses. With some components there, we successfully integrated data analysis in R with Python implementation. We also have a few projects using open source models and integrating transformer models from Hugging Face. R is a star for any data-wrangling tasks and data visualizations!\nWhat are your plans for the upcoming months?\nOne area of interest that we plan to focus on is the use of responsible AI and responsible practices. This is crucial not only for AI but also for any data management that we undertake. Responsible modeling and responsible data science are important concepts that need more attention. We have seen instances where people intentionally or accidentally manipulate statistics, and this needs to change. We must focus on being data governors and ensure our analysis is responsible. This includes managing the data and the application size, as well as ensuring continuity of work. Many packages are available, but maintaining and updating them is challenging. Our future work is to contribute to the community by ensuring the continuity of our packages so developers can rely on them.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nMany people talk about large language models, but the focus is often on their applicability and use cases. While many amazing models are available, businesses need to see how they can be practically applied to their needs. It’s not just about text generation – image generation and other areas are also important. When we share the use cases with the businesses, the possibilities they haven’t considered often amaze them. Therefore, there is a growing demand for case studies demonstrating these models’ practical applications rather than just tutorials.\nWe focus on the practical applications of tools. Our approach is to identify a problem and explore various solutions. I’m not interested in specific software packages but in finding efficient solutions to problems. If there’s a new tool that can help me solve a problem more effectively, I’m open to learning about it and sharing my experience with others.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nThe most important technique is interaction, networking, and keeping the connection alive among the group members. This is especially crucial when you have a larger proportion of new users in the group. It’s important to ensure that once they learn the skills, they understand that we are all busy and have business obligations to attend to. Therefore, it’s necessary to make sure that we keep the group relevant to all members, without getting carried away by our busy lives.\nThis is more about sitting together and engaging in problem-solving exercises, such as preparing for AWS certification. The group can help with other tasks, too, creating additional value beyond just learning. This is where the benefits of membership come in. Members are also motivated to give back to the community, as they can use their skills in real life, not just for learning purposes.\nFor instance, we have an AWS data practitioner interested in learning R. However, this is an opportunity for that person to share their expertise and contribute to the group. Similarly, we have a cybersecurity professional who is also interested in learning R. But this is an opportunity for them to present a use case on how machine learning can automate some of their tasks. They are also willing to share their knowledge, which may not have been considered. Therefore, it’s important to create a diverse experience for all members and engage with them in all possible ways. While it can be difficult to involve every group member, it’s crucial to understand their general interests and what’s important for them and focus on their professional development.\nTake a moment to analyze where your members come from and their future plans and steps. Discuss their next career moves. It will be beneficial to provide networking opportunities where members can get referrals for job searches and advice for their next career move. These opportunities are quite important. Therefore, promotions should always be the end goal. You cannot become complacent or content with where you are because life is about growth and evolution."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Contributed by Charlie Gao, Director at Hibiki AI Limited\n\n\n\n{nanonext} is an R binding to the state of the art C messaging library NNG (Nanomsg Next Generation), created as a successor to ZeroMQ. It was originally developed as a fast and reliable messaging interface for use in machine learning pipelines. With implementations readily available in languages including C++, Go, Python, and Rust, it allowed individual modules to be written in the most appropriate language and for them to be piped together in a single workflow.\n{mirai} is a package that enables asynchronous evaluation in R, built on top of {nanonext}. It was initially created purely as a demonstration of the reliable RPC (remote procedure call) protocol from {nanonext}. However, open-sourcing this project greatly facilitated its discovery and dissemination, eventually leading to a long-term, cross-industry collaboration with Will Landau, a statistician in the life sciences industry, author of the {targets} package for reproducible pipelines. He ended up creating the {crew} package to extend {mirai} to handle the increasingly complex and demanding high-performance computing needs faced by his users.\nAs this work was progressing, security was still a missing piece of the puzzle. The NNG library supported integration with Mbed TLS (a SSL/TLS library developed under the Trusted Firmware Project), however secure connections were not yet a part of the R landscape.\nThe R Consortium, by way of an Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) grant, funded the work to implement this functionality from the underlying libraries and to also devise a means of configuring the required certificates in R. The stated intention was to provide a user-friendly interface for doing so. The end result somewhat exceeded these goals, with the default allowing for zero-configuration, single-use certificates to be generated on-the-fly. This affords an unparalleled level of usability, not requiring end users to have any knowledge of the intricacies of TLS.\nWill Landau talks about the impact TLS has had on his work:\n“I sought to extend {mirai} to a wide variety of computing environments through {crew}, from traditional clusters to Amazon Web Services. The integration of TLS into {nanonext} increases the confidence with which {mirai} can be deployed in these powerful environments, accelerating downstream applications and {targets} pipelines.”\nThe project to extend {mirai} to high-performance computing environments was featured in a workshop on simulation workflows in the life sciences, given at R/Pharma in October 2023 (video and materials accessible from https://github.com/wlandau/rpharma2023).\nWith the seed planted in {nanonext}, {mirai} and {crew} have grown to form an elegant and performant foundation for an emerging landscape of asynchronous and parallel programming tools. They already provide new back-ends for {parallel}, {promises}, {plumber}, {targets}, and Shiny, as well as high-level interfaces such as {crew.cluster} for traditional clusters and {crew.aws.batch} for the cloud.\n\n\n\nCharlie Gao, Director at Hibiki AI Limited"

    "title": "Ann Arbor R User Group: Harnessing the Power of R and GitHub",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium talked to Barry Decicco, founder, and organizer of the Ann Arbor R User Group, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Barry shared his experience working with R as a statistician and highlighted the current trends in the R language in his industry. He also emphasized the significance of organizing regular events and effective communication for managing an R User Group (RUG).\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nThroughout my professional career, I have gained extensive experience in various industries as a statistician. Statisticians are often thought of as either staying in one industry for their entire career or frequently transitioning between them. I have followed the latter path, having held positions at Ford Motor Company, their spinoff Visteon, the University of Michigan School of Nursing, the University of Michigan Health System, Nissan Motor Company, Volkswagen Credit (as a contractor), Michigan State University, and currently Quality Insights.\nI have been using the R programming language consistently for several years now. I have extensively worked with R during my tenure at Michigan State University as a member of the Center for Statistical Training and Research (CSTAT). CSTAT serves as the university’s statistical laboratory. Our team heavily relied on R as our preferred software for statistical analysis.\nOur reporting process involved using R Markdown reports. Steven Pierce, the assistant director, developed a highly complex and upgradeable system using R Markdown to process data. This system allowed us to initiate a report and then trigger the R Markdown file to process the data and generate the final datasets for each report. Another R Markdown file was then called to render the report. This streamlined process enabled us to produce about 40 PDF reports within 45 minutes. The process remained relatively straightforward when we needed to make modifications, such as changing the reporting period from fiscal years to calendar years or adding or subtracting individuals, units, or departments.\nI have recently started a new job primarily working with the SAS programming language. Initially, I will focus on gaining proficiency in this area. After that, I will transition to performing more in-depth analysis and ad hoc reporting, requiring me to use additional tools and resources. I have also moved to a new system where we use Hive or Hadoop through Databricks. As part of my role, I am responsible for taking over the current reporting system and identifying future reporting needs. This will require me to use R extensively.\nBefore the COVID pandemic, the R users group met in Ann Arbor. However, the pandemic dealt a major blow to the group, and we are still recovering from its impact. In our efforts to revive the group, we continued with the same theme as before: a mix of programming and statistics. However, we have been focusing more on programming and simpler analysis to make it easier to get the group restarted. We have also introduced some new presenters covering topics such as machine learning pipelines in their presentations.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Ann Arbor?\nR has become a popular programming language in academia and will likely remain relevant in this field. However, general coding and applications are more prevalent in the industrial sector. Python is gaining popularity because it attracts a broader range of programmers, including those who are not data or analytics specialists. Therefore, R will continue to be a significant but specialized tool.\nCurrently, I have noticed a significant decrease in the usage of SAS. This trend is driven by the dislike of license fees among individual and corporate users. The matter is further complicated by corporate accounting practices, where different funding sources may have varying spending restrictions. As a result, organizations may end up incurring higher salary expenses because of the complexity of corporate accounting processes.\nIf a company spends a fixed amount, say $10,000, on SAS licenses yearly, it might not like it. But then, it may hire additional staff to do the same work SAS did earlier. The salary of these people, and other associated costs, may come from a different funding source. As a result, the company may spend a significant amount of money, ranging from $120,000 to $150,000 annually, to replace a smaller amount of $10,000 to $20,000 annually. However, whether this arrangement is acceptable would depend on the funding source.\nDo you have an upcoming meeting planned? What are your plans for the RUG for this year?\nOur next presenter, Brittany Buggs, Staff Data Analyst at Rocket Mortgage, will demonstrate the usage of the GT package for generating tables. Additionally, we are striving to establish closer integration with the Ann Arbor chapter of the American Statistical Association to foster mutual support and collaboration between the groups. We have been conducting hybrid meetings catering to in-person and virtual attendees. Ann Arbor Spark, a local startup business development organization, has generously provided us with a physical meeting space. Our meetings follow a hybrid format, recognizing the convenience and accessibility it offers to many individuals.\nThis year, I aim to have more presenters as I have been doing all the presentations by myself. I plan to raise awareness about R, R Markdown, and Quarto and show people how these tools can be useful. I will promote these tools at the University of Michigan and other companies.\nWhat trends do you currently see in the R language?\nWhen it comes to data analysis, R has a clear advantage. The tidyverse syntax is easy to understand, even for those unfamiliar with data tables or Pandas-like programming paradigms.\nWhen working with data tables, both base R and Pandas use programming languages that differ significantly from English, which can make understanding them difficult. On the other hand, R Markdown has a notable advantage in that it makes it easy and quick to generate HTML documents. For instance, my former supervisor at C-STAT spent much time creating visually appealing PDF documents because his reports were highly customized. However, if your main goal is to produce polished reports relatively quickly, R Markdown is the better option.\nI understand that my main focus is the transition to Quarto. As someone who used to work with R Markdown, I have been learning more about Quarto and adjusting to its features. However, I am concerned about how new users may react to Quarto. I plan to give presentations throughout the year to gauge their responses and better understand any potential issues that may arise.\nMoreover, I’ve noticed that many people are unaware of R Markdown’s capabilities. To address this, I conducted an introductory session on R Markdown for a group at the University of Michigan. During my thirty-minute presentation, the participants were surprised by the diverse functionalities of R Markdown, as they were used to working with JavaScript and basic R. Although I had inferior knowledge compared to some of the individuals in the group, my ability to perform certain tasks using R Markdown impressed them.\nOne of the benefits of R Markdown is its ability to run multiple languages, with each language being executed chunk by chunk. I hope Quarto will also support this feature.\nIn the past, I have presented on calling R from SAS and SAS from R. During these presentations, I demonstrated how to run a SAS job within an R chunk. However, this approach has a limitation. For it to work, SAS must be accessible from the computer running the R code. This means the SAS installation must be on the computer or a network drive that the computer recognizes as a local drive. On a certain occasion, while using Enterprise Guide on a Linux machine, I faced a problem. I couldn’t locate the executable file (EXE) for SAS from my computer, which obstructed me from executing a SAS job.\nIt is now possible for individuals to use R Markdown with their preferred programming languages. For instance, R Markdown can be used with Pandas for most cases, which can help individuals produce visually appealing reports quickly. With this approach, all the work can be done within Pandas, and users need only basic knowledge of R. Therefore, Quarto can be seen as a language for report writing only. I will keep an eye on this situation and evaluate its effectiveness.\nI want to highlight the smooth combination of Git and GitHub with R. I use GitHub frequently in my work, though I am not very skilled because RStudio IDE fulfills most of my requirements. I rarely face conflicts due to my carelessness; I must interact with Git and GitHub manually.\nI highly recommend the book “Happy Git with R” as an essential resource for beginners. This comprehensive guide provides a step-by-step approach to setting up and using Git and GitHub effectively in R.\nWhen using Git in conjunction with R, you can access a detailed transaction history that can be reviewed anytime. I have found this feature incredibly useful and have been able to recover important work using this method. As a data management instructor at MSU, I have also taught my students how to execute this process manually. However, having R Studio automatically handle this task is much more convenient.\nIn fact, I used SPSS to conduct a project and leveraged GitHub as an experiment. I utilized the data management capabilities of RStudio and found the results satisfactory.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nI suggest that RUG organizers should arrange regular monthly meetings. It would be advantageous to fix these meetings on the same day and time every month, as it will help attendees get accustomed to the routine and know when to expect them.\nIn my years of working with different groups, I have noticed that if we don’t consciously communicate regularly, our communication will become less effective over time. This can lead to a lack of new ideas and engagement, and we may unintentionally exclude potential participants.\nFor almost 20 years, I have been part of a group that communicated through a university mailing list. However, we faced difficulties as the list was not easily discoverable through search engines like Google. This made it challenging for new individuals to find or contact us. We have taken steps to tackle this problem by introducing Meetup as a new tool that can be used alongside or instead of our traditional mailing list. The main benefit of Meetup is that it is easily searchable on Google, which makes it simple for anyone to locate and get in touch with our group.\nI want to emphasize the importance of effective communication. Neglecting communication efforts can cause a decline in communication quality. I have personally witnessed this happening in different groups, and I have seen others experiencing similar challenges."

    "title": "The Cleveland R User Group’s Journey Through Pandemic Adaptations and Baseball Analytics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year, R Consortium talked to John Blischak and Tim Hoolihan of the Cleveland R User Group about their regular structured and casual virtual meetups during the pandemic. Recently, Alec Wong, another co-organizer of the Cleveland R User Group, updated the R Consortium about how the group provides a networking platform for a small but vibrant local R community. Alec shared details of a recent event from the group regarding the use of R for analyzing baseball data. He also discussed some tools for keeping the group inclusive and improving communication among group members.\n\n\n\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Fisheries and Wildlife from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2013, and my Master of Science degree in Statistical Ecology from Cornell University in late 2018. During my graduate program, I gained extensive experience using R, which is the de facto language of the ecological sciences. I discovered a passion for the language, as it is extremely intuitive and pleasant to work with.\nAfter completing my program in 2018, I moved to Cleveland and immediately began attending the Cleveland R User Group in 2019, and have been a consistent member ever since. I eagerly look forward to each of our events.\nAfter completing my graduate program, I started working at Progressive Insurance. Working for a large organization like Progressive provides me with many diverse opportunities to make use of my extensive experience with R. I was happy to find a vibrant R community within the company, which allowed me to connect with other R users, share knowledge, and I enthusiastically offer one-on-one assistance to analysts from all over Progressive.\nStarting in 2022, I accepted the role of co-organizer of the Cleveland R User Group. As a co-organizer, I help with various tasks related to organizing events, such as the one we held last September. I am passionate about fostering the growth of these communities and helping to attract more individuals who enjoy using R.\nOur group events are currently being held in a hybrid format. When we manage to find space, we will meet in person, such as when we met to view the 2023 posit::conf in October–several members visited in person and watched and discussed videos from the conference. Most of our meetups continue to be virtual, including our Saturday morning coffee meetups, but we are actively searching for a more permanent physical space to accommodate our regular meetups.\nI am only one of several co-organizers of the Cleveland R user group. The other co-organizers include Tim Hoolihan from Centric Consulting, John Blischak who operates his consulting firm JDB Software Consulting, LLC, and Jim Hester, currently a Senior Software Engineer atNetflix. Their contributions are invaluable and the community benefits tremendously from their efforts.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Cleveland? \nI believe interest in R has been fairly steady over time in Cleveland since 2019. We have a handful of members who attend regularly, and typically each meeting one or two new attendees will introduce themselves.\nI would venture to say that R continues to be used frequently in academic settings in Cleveland, though I am ‌unfamiliar with the standards at local universities. At least two of our members belong to local universities and they use R in their curricula.\nAs for industry usage, many local companies, including Progressive use R. At Progressive, we have a small, but solid R community; although it is not as large as the Python community, I believe that the R community is more vibrant. This seems characteristic of R communities in varying contexts, as far as I’ve seen. Another Cleveland company, the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, makes use of R for data science. In September 2023 we were fortunate to invite one of their principal data scientists to speak to us about their methods and analyses. (More details below.)\nTypically, our attendance is local to the greater Cleveland area, but with virtual meetups, we’ve been able to host speakers and attendees from across the country; this was a silver lining of the pandemic. We also hold regular Saturday morning coffee and informal chat sessions, and it’s great to see fresh faces from outside Cleveland joining in.\nYou had a Meetup titled “How Major League Teams Use R to Analyze Baseball Data”, can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?\nOn September 27th, 2023, we invited Keith Woolner, principal data scientist at the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, to give a presentation to our group. This was our first in-person meetup after the pandemic, and Progressive generously sponsored our event, affording us a large presentation space, food, and A/V support. We entertained a mixed audience from the public as well as Progressive employees.\nKeith spoke to us about “How Major League Baseball Teams Use R to Analyze Baseball Data.” In an engaging session, he showcased several statistical methods used in sports analytics, the code used to produce these analyses, and visualizations of the data and statistical methods. Of particular interest to me was his analysis using a generalized additive model (GAM) to evaluate the relative performance of catchers’ ability to “frame” a catch; in other words, their ability to convince the umpire a strike occurred. The presentation held some relevance for everyone, whether they were interested in Cleveland baseball, statistics, or R, making it a terrific option for our first in-person presentation since January 2020. His presentation drove a lot of engagement both during and after the session.\n\n\n\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future? \nOne of our co-organizers, John Blischak, has created a slick website using GitHub Pages to showcase our group and used GitHub issue templates to create a process for speakers to submit talks. Additionally, the Cleveland R User group has posted recordings of our meetups to YouTube since 2017, increasing our visibility and accessibility. Many people at Progressive could not attend our September meetup and asked for the recording of our September 2023 meetup as soon as it was available.\nRecently, we have also created a Discord server, a platform similar to Slack. This was suggested by one of our members, Ken Wong, and it has been a great addition to our community. We have been growing the server organically since October of last year by marketing it to attendees who visit our events, particularly on the Saturday morning meetups. This has opened up an additional space for us to collaborate and share content asynchronously. Ken has done an excellent job of organizing the server and has added some automated processes that post from R blogs, journal articles, and tweets from high-profile R users. Overall, we are pleased with our progress and look forward to continuing to improve our initiatives.\n\nHow do I Join?\nR Consortium’s R User Group and Small Conference Support Program (RUGS) provides grants to help R groups organize, share information, and support each other worldwide.

    "text": "Nadejda Sero, the founder of the R Ladies Cotonou chapter, shared with the R Consortium her experiences learning R, the challenges of running an R community in a developing country, and her plans for 2024. She also emphasized the importance of considering the realities of the local R community when organizing an R User Group (RUG).\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nMy name is Nadejda Sero, and I am a plant population and theoretical ecologist. I have a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and Natural Resources Management and a Master of Science in Biostatistics from the University of Abomey-Calavi (Benin, West Africa). I discovered R during my Master’s studies in 2015. From the first coding class, I found R exciting and fun. However, as assignments became more challenging, I grew somewhat frustrated due to my lack of prior experience with a programming language.\nSo, I jumped on Twitter (current X). I tweeted, “The most exciting thing I ever did is learning how to code in R!” The tweet caught the attention of members of the R Ladies global team. They asked if I was interested in spreading #rstats love with the women’s community in Benin. I was thrilled by the opportunity and thus began my journey with R-Ladies Global.\nThe early days were challenging due to the novelty of the experience. I did not know much about community building and social events organization. I started learning about the R-Ladies community and available resources. The most significant work was adjusting the resources/tools used by other chapters to fit my realities in Benin. My country, a small French-speaking developing African country, had poor internet access and few organizations focused on gender minorities. (We are doing slightly better now.) On top of that, I often needed to translate some materials into French for the chapter.\nAs I struggled to make headway, the R-Ladies team launched a mentoring program for organizers. I was fortunate enough to participate in the pilot mentorship. The program helped me understand how to identify, adjust, and use the most effective tools for R-Ladies Cotonou. I also gained confidence as an organizer and with community work. With my fantastic mentor’s help, I revived the local chapter of R-Ladies in Cotonou, Benin. I later joined her in the R-Ladies Global team to manage the mentoring program. You can read more about my mentoring experience on the R-Ladies Global blog.\nHappy members of R-Ladies Cotonou sharing some pastries after the presentation. At our first official meetup, the attendees discovered and learned everything about R-Ladies Global and R-Ladies Cotonou.\nI am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of the R-Ladies community these last six years. I also discovered other fantastic groups like AfricaR. I am particularly proud of the journey with R-Ladies Cotonou. I am also thankful to the people who support us and contribute to keeping R-Ladies Cotonou alive.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Benin?\nR has been commonly used in academia and more moderately in the professional world over the past 2-3 years. For example, I worked with people from different areas of science. I worked in a laboratory where people came to us needing data analysts or biostatisticians. We always used R for such tasks, and many registered in R training sessions. The participants of these sessions also came from the professional world and public health. I have been out of the country for a while now, but the R community is booming. More people are interested in learning and using R in different settings and fields. I recently heard that people are fascinated with R for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is exciting to see that people are integrating R into various fields. There are also a few more training opportunities for R enthusiasts.\nCan you tell us about your plans for the R Ladies Cotonou for the new year?\nMore meetups from our Beninese community, other R-Ladies chapters, and allies.\nWe are planning a series of meetups that feature students from the training “Science des Données au Féminin en Afrique,” a data science with R program for francophone women organized by the Benin chapter of OWSD (Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World). We have three initial speakers for the series: the student who won the excellence prize and the two grantees from R-Ladies Cotonou. The program is an online training requiring good internet, which is unfortunately expensive and unreliable. If you want good internet, you must pay the price.\nR-Ladies Cotonou supported two students (from Benin and Burkina Faso) by creating a small “internet access” grant using the R Consortium grant received in 2020.\nThe meetup speaker is taking us through a review of the most practical methods of importing and exporting datasets in R. The attendees are listening and taking notes.\nThis next series of meetups will focus on R tutorials with a bonus. The speakers will additionally share their stories embracing R through the training. The first speaker, Jospine Doris Abadassi, will discuss dashboard creation with Shiny and its potential applications to public health. I hope more folks from the training join the series to share their favorite R tools.\nI believe these meetups will assist in expanding not only the R-Ladies but the entire R community. I particularly enjoy it when local people share what they have learned. It further motivates the participants to be bold with R.\nAbout “Science des Données au Féminin en Afrique“, it is the first time I know that a data science training is free for specifically African women from French-speaking areas. Initiated by Dr. Bernice Bancole and Prof. Thierry Warin, the program trains 100 African francophone women in data science using R, emphasizing projects focused on societal problem resolution. The training concluded its first batch and is now recruiting for the second round. So, the community has expanded, and a few more people are using R. I appreciate that the training focuses on helping people develop projects that address societal issues. I believe that it enriches the community.\nAs I said in my last interview with the R consortium, “In some parts of the world, before expecting to find R users or a vivid R community, you first need to create favorable conditions for their birth – teach people what R is and its usefulness in professional, academic, and even artistic life.” It is especially true in Benin, whose official language is French. English is at least a third language for the average multilingual Beninese. Many people are uncomfortable or restrained in using R since most R materials are in English. I hope this OWSD Benin training receives all the contributions to keep running long-term. You can reach the leading team at owsd.benin@gmail.com.\nOur other plan is to collaborate with other R-Ladies chapters and RUGS who speak French. If you speak French and want to teach us something, please email cotonou@rladies.org.\nOtherwise, I will be working on welcoming and assisting new organizers for our chapter. So, for anyone interested, please email cotonou@rladies.org.\nAre you guys currently hosting your events online or in-person? And what are your plans for hosting events in 2024?\nWe used to hold in-person events when we started. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and we had to decide whether to hold events online. Organizing online events became challenging due to Cotonou’s lack of reliable internet access or expensive packages. As a result, we only held one online event with poor attendance. We took a long break from our activities.\nGoing forward, our events will be hybrid, a mix of in-person and online events. In-person events will allow attendees to use the existing infrastructure of computers and internet access of our allies. It also offers an opportunity to interact with participants. Therefore, I am working with people in Cotonou to identify locations with consistent internet access where attendees can go to attend the meetups. Online events will be necessary to accommodate speakers from outside of the country. It will be open to attendees unable to make it in person.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nThe techniques and tools should depend on the realities of the community. What language is comfortable for attendees? What meeting modality, online or in person, works best for participants?\nAs mentioned earlier, I was inexperienced, and organizing a chapter was daunting. My mentoring experience shifted my perspective. I realized that I needed to adjust many available resources/tools. Organizing meetups became easier as I integrated all these factors.\nFor example, our chapter prioritizes other communication and advertisement tools like regular emails and WhatsApp. The group is mildly active on social media, where the R community is alive (X/Twitter, Mastodon). It is easier to have a WhatsApp group to share information due to its popularity within our community. We recently created an Instagram account and will get LinkedIn and Facebook pages (with more co-organizers). I would love a website to centralize everything related to R-Ladies Cotonou. Using emails is an adjustment to Meetup, which is unpopular in Benin. Getting sponsors or partners and providing a few small grants for good internet would help tremendously our future online events.\nAdjusting helps us to reach people where they are. It is imperative to consider the community, its realities, and its needs. I often asked our meetup participants their expectations, “What do you anticipate from us?” “What would you like to see in the future?” Then, I take notes. Also, we have Google Forms to collect comments, suggestions, potential speakers, contributors, and preferred meeting times. It is crucial to encourage people to participate, especially gender minorities less accustomed to such gatherings.\nI have also attempted to make the meetups more welcoming and friendly in recent years. I always had some food/snacks and drinks available (thanks to friends and allies). It helps make people feel at ease and focus better. I hope the tradition continues for in-person meetups. It is valuable to make the meetups welcoming and friendly. How people feel is essential. If they come and feel like it is a regular lecture or course, they may decide to skip it. But, if they come to the meetup and learn while having fun, or at the very least, enjoy it a little, it benefits everyone.\nThese are some of the key aspects to consider when organizing a meetup. It is critical to consider the people since you are doing it for them. Also, make sure you have support and many co-organizers if possible.\nAll materials live on our GitHub page for people who can’t attend physical events. Another solution would be recording and uploading the session on the R-Ladies Global YouTube or our channel.\nWhat industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?\nI am now a Ph.D. student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.\nR has no longer been my first programming language since I started graduate school. I still use R for data tidying data analysis but less extensively. I worked a lot with R as a master’s student and Biostatistician. It was constant learning and growth as a programmer. I had a lot of fun writing my first local package. However, I now work more with mathematical software like Maple and Mathematica. I wish R were as smooth and intuitive as this software for mathematical modeling. I like translating Maple code to R code, especially when I need to make visualizations.\nI am addicted to ggplot2 for graphs. I love learning new programming languages but am really attached to R (it’s a 9-year-old relationship now). I developed many skills while programming in R. R helped me become intuitive, a fast learner, and sharp with other programming languages.\nMy most recent project that utilized R, from beginning to end, was a project in my current lab on the evolutionary strategies of plants in stochastic environments. We used R for demographic data tidying and wrangling. Data analysis was a mix of statistical and mathematical models. It was a good occasion to practice writing functions and use new packages. I enjoy writing functions for any task to automate repetitive tasks, which reduces the need for copying and pasting code. I also learned more subtleties in analyzing demographic data from my advisor and colleagues who have used R longer."

It started with a motivation as to why to consider using open source and specifically R for regulatory submissions. The group then proceeded to show cases of the pilot 1 and 2 submission to FDA.\nThe conclusion was an insightful discussion for about 20 minutes with the participants on the lessons learned, key factors to sort in line for broader adoption of R and Shiny for regulatory submissions, and what would be most added value for a regulatory shiny app, namely\n\nHow to deploy the submitted R package and Shiny App to guarantee the clinical outcomes can be smoothly reproduced on the regulatory side\nWhat would be the ultimate purpose of a regulatory shiny app, and what are value-added features? Should the app only focus on offering interactivities to facilitate the review of tables, figures, and listings in CSR, or should it also include designed features to enable exploratory, descriptive analysis (e.g., for subgroups) to certain degrees, which may greatly shorten back-and-forth inquiry between regulator and drug developer?\nValidation and version traceability of dependent open source R packages used in the submission package\nHow to leverage existing and emerging cross-industrial initiatives (e.g. R consortium) in the open source space to support and ease the potential technical issue during the adoption of R for submission\n\nAccompanying this post, the full presentation slide deck is made publicly available here, inviting further exploration and discussion.\nThe R Consortium’s presentation at Swissmedic represents a hopeful step toward more interactive, efficient, and transparent regulatory submissions. As the conversation between the R Consortium and regulatory bodies continues, our future collection of pilot projects hopefully will offer richer examples and templates to our growing R community within the pharmaceutical sector, spanning both regulatory and drug developer sides.\nTo find out more about the R Consortium Submission Working Group, please see: https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/"

    "title": "Full-time Korea R User Group Founder Victor Lee Sees AI Future for R and Quarto Textbooks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium recently interviewed Victor Lee, organizer of the Korea R User Group, about his role establishing and expanding the Korean R community. Victor shared his journey, beginning with an introduction to R and open source programming languages while working at the Hyundai Motor Company, and later, his efforts in establishing the tidyverse community in Korea. He highlighted his extensive experience with R, including writing blog posts, publishing Quarto books, and building websites for the Korea R User Group. Victor will be a Software Carpentry instructor at the Software Carpentry Workshops at Sejong University.\nPlease share about your background and your involvement in the R Community.\nMy first introduction to our community was about 10 years ago, and it wasn’t a good experience. I used to work at the Hyundai Motor Company at that time and was intrigued by the software carpentry led by Greg Wilson. I also delved into statistics and open-source programming languages, particularly S and R programming. I was heavily involved in posting about tidyverse, which was my entry point into the community environment. In Korea, I sought out the Korean community, which mainly focused on the basics. This made me realize the need for a community in Korea based on tidyverse principles, and that’s why I started the tidyverse community in Korea 10 years ago.\nI was first introduced to S-PLUS during my undergraduate years as a statistics major, and I was fascinated by its superior graphics compared to SAS/SPSS. After majoring in computer engineering and working at Hyundai Motor Company for 10 years, I obtained a Software Carpentry Instructor certification and translated “Python for Informatics” into a Korean book. I became captivated by the Hadleyverse, and Since 2016, I have been co-organizing the Seoul R Meetup, sponsored by Kyobo DPLANEX (a continuous sponsor and is currently the largest sponsor of the Seoul R Meetup, representing one of South Korea’s leading insurance companies) alongside Choonghyun Ryu, the founder of the Korea R User Group. In 2021, we hosted the Korea R Conference, and in 2021, we established the Korea R User Group as a non-profit organization, transitioning from a community to an official organization.\nWhat is your level of experience with the R language?\nWith the support of the R community, ChatGPT, and Copilot AI, I now confidently tackle any data science problem using R. For about 10 years, I’ve consistently written blog posts using R Markdown and now Quarto. Upgrading my e-books with Bookdown led to the publication of five Quarto books on data science. Using the Quarto framework, I also built the Korea R User Group and R Conference websites. As a civic data journalist, I’ve written around 100 articles utilizing R’s visualization capabilities. Reflecting on my journey, I see how effectively I’ve applied the R language in various fields.\nWhat industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?\nI originally set up the Korean R community 10 years ago and am a founding member of the nonprofit Korea R User Group, established three years ago. I left KPMG to dedicate my time to running the Korea R User Group. This year, I have been fully involved in managing the organization and leading several projects, including two major abandoned projects, focusing on them for the past few months.\nCurrently, I am focusing on publishing and developing open statistical packages at a non-profit public interest corporation. In 2020, with good intentions, I started the “Open Statistical Package” project to independently develop statistical packages like SAS, SPSS, and Minitab. However, some Shiny developers without a strong background in statistics took the project in their direction, causing it to lose steam. It felt as though they had hijacked the project and the hard work the Korea R User Group put in, leaving us frustrated and disappointed.\nTo prevent this kind of thing from happening again, we’re beefing up our license policy, including trademark registration for BitStat[1]. We’re also switching up our development engines to webr and shinylive and are in the process of creating BitStat2[2].\n[1]: https://github.com/bit2r/BitStat [2]: https://github.com/bit2r/BitStat2\nWe also established a publishing company named “BitStat” as the Korea R User Group promoted Quarto digital writing as a new open source project. Recently, we have published and released five data science books, expanding the base of R users. While writing the sixth book on probability and statistics, I restarted the development of open statistical packages using Web-R and Shinylive.\nR has evolved from a simple data analysis and statistical language to a tool that can replace office software. I now use Quarto to create almost all documents, and R is the first language I use in developing the open statistical package that I am currently working on.\nWhy do industry professionals come to your user group? What is the benefit for attending?\nIn Korea, about 20 to 30 years ago, R was the number one programming language for data science and statistics, particularly in areas like machine learning. However, with the rise of Python, many R users transitioned to Python due to its increasing popularity. Despite this shift, R remains significant in Korea, with many people continuing to use both R and Python.\nFor my day-to-day work, I find R quite convenient and easy to use, especially for therapeutic data and open-source case studies. This year, I’ve noticed that users who join the Korea R User Group come from diverse backgrounds, including drug discovery, regulatory agency, and real estate.\nOver the past decade, many users joined the group to determine whether Python or R was better suited for their work. However, the recent trend clearly leans towards artificial intelligence development, such as LLM (Large Language Model) development. Participants from various industries with an interest in quantitative analysis are now attending the user group.\nTheir motivation for attending, apart from AI fields represented by LLM, is to acquire the latest technology in other data science areas and to gain knowledge from diverse, in-depth analysis experiences and model development. Additionally, many people come to obtain information about Quarto, ggplot, gt, and shiny, seeking business opportunities related to these tools.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nThis year, our community in Korea is focusing on Quarto due to upcoming government policy changes. Analog methods are expected to disappear within five years, so the government is funding the development of AI digital textbooks. I believe Quarto technology, the next generation of R Markdown, is perfect for this purpose.\nAs generative artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant attention in Korea, there is growing interest in using R and Python together with generative AI to solve data science problems and increase productivity, rather than focusing on the languages themselves. When using generative AI with languages such as R, Python, and SQL, it becomes necessary to find tools that can automate and store the outputs, inevitably leading to increased interest in Quarto.\nThis perspective has been reinforced by my experience using Quarto in various ways, starting from R Markdown. I have come to realize that Quarto is truly well-suited for generative AI and data science. If other countries are developing AI texts using Quarto or R Markdown, we could introduce this technology to the Korean market and the Korean government.\nHaving written five books – plus a sixth on probability and statistics – I’ve experimented with various features of Quarto books. I’ve realized we no longer need older statistical packages like SAS and SPSS. My current project involves implementing statistical software using WebAssembly (WASM) technology.\nWe would like to get to know you more personally. Can you please tell me about yourself? For example, your hobbies/interests or anything else you want to share.\nInitially, I wasn’t sure if I would succeed, but I became involved in election campaigns and grew passionate about analyzing political and election data. My interest lies in using data to uncover trends and insights from various social datasets.\nNext month, we will have a data journalism meetup, and I have friends who will join because of the articles I wrote. They will showcase some of their analyses on TV, including summaries of data related to election campaigns.\nI first developed a connection with data while majoring in statistics and then pursued computer engineering in graduate school. Although this combination of backgrounds is common now, it was unusual in Korea at the time, giving me a unique career path. My passion for open-source software and faith in the community have driven me to where I am today.\nI enjoy analyzing data, and whenever I come across interesting datasets, I analyze them and document my experiences on my blog. This hobby, along with the copyright-free nature of data, led me to develop an interest in predicting election winners using data from annual elections in South Korea. Since 2016, I have experienced three general elections, presidential elections, and local elections. Although there won’t be an election next year, I am very much looking forward to the next one."

    "text": "Vincent Guyader, organizer of the R Addicts Paris and president of ThinkR, recently updated the R Consortium on the group’s activities. Last year, Vincent discussed the application of R in developing solutions for industrial problems. He emphasized the importance of helping people become fluent in R and leveraging the language to add value to their work. ThinkR is dedicated to enhancing R proficiency in various industries. The R Addicts Paris, one of France’s oldest and largest R user groups with 1,800 members, continues to foster a strong R community under Vincent’s leadership.\nPlease share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nMy name is Vincent, and I have been using R since my student days. During my studies, I took on freelance R projects for various companies. Currently, I head a company called ThinkR, where we have a team of over 10 experts specializing in everything related to R. Our services include training, consulting, developing Shiny applications, creating R packages, and more. We also collaborate with Posit and handle hardware installations for clients, primarily in France but also in Switzerland, Belgium, and other parts of Europe.\nSince 2018, I have been managing the R user group in Paris, known as the R Addicts Paris. It’s one of the oldest and possibly the largest R user groups, with 1,800 members. I aimed to organize meetups every three months, but the next one has been delayed due to internal organizational issues. I genuinely enjoy helping people become fluent in R and use the language to add value to their work.\nWhat challenges do you face in organizing the R Addict Paris group and how do you overcome those challenges?\nOne of the main challenges is that our users are not professional programmers or developers; they are specialists in fields like biology and finance. They have to shift their mindset to use programming languages. My daily job involves helping these individuals embrace software development. Coming from a genetics and biochemistry background, I understand how challenging this can be for non-developers. However, I love doing this, and I have a dedicated, competent team to assist.\nBased on your work with ThinkR, which industries in France do you see using R?\nWe have clients in various fields across France, including finance, retail, and research. The health sector is particularly prominent. For instance, a company that used SAS a few years ago now uses R & Python. About half of our clients currently use Python. While we provide Python installation on hardware, we don’t offer Python training yet.\nWe are committed to being the sole organization in France that can certify R users and developers. The French government has authorized us to issue an official certification akin to a diploma. Our goal is to elevate R proficiency across various fields in France. Our clients include businesses and individuals, with many investing their resources to learn proper software and programming skills.\nDo you host online or in-person events?\nI chose not to host online events. It’s a very opinionated choice because most meetups switched to online formats during the pandemic. At ThinkR, we are a fully remote company, and I spend my day on Zoom. While remote training is effective, I’ve found that in-person events work better for our user group.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people who are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nOne of the main challenges we face as a group is finding female speakers. I try to avoid having only male speakers, but I only get female speakers every fifth or sixth event, which is not enough. I encourage other R user group organizers to recognize our power to give a voice to different kinds of people. I push myself to include more female speakers. Sometimes, I encounter highly qualified women who hesitate to speak, while less experienced men are more willing. It’s challenging, but I strive to maintain a balanced representation.\nI consciously avoid engaging with speakers who lack substance, ensuring I have time to encourage qualified women to share their knowledge. Despite my efforts, female representation remains below 20%. A few years ago, my colleague Diane and I tried to connect with the R-Ladies Paris group. Many men are actively engaged there, and I wonder why that is.\nThere are many skilled women in the R community, which includes biologists and geneticists. There’s no excuse for the lack of female representation. We must remember our influence and endorse individuals who truly represent our values.\nWhat are some trending topics in R in your R User Group?\nI’ve noticed a decline in interest in statistics over the past two to five years. During meetups, we rarely discuss statistics. The machine learning and AI fields aren’t well-represented in R, possibly because most people in these fields use Python. It could also be due to regional differences or my network.\nYou had a Meetup “Raddicts x RTE – {webr} – Shinyproxy and return of the Reconteres 2024” on 19th June, can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?\nFor this event, we had two male speakers. Colin Fay discussed {webr}, a new JavaScript capability for launching user insights in the browser. This is powerful for deploying Shiny applications. Valentin Cadoret talked about new Shinyproxy functionalities, and tools that enhance the deployment of Shiny applications. So we focused heavily on Shiny once again."

    "text": "In 2022, Edson Kambeu, founder and organizer of the Botswana R User Group, shared his plans with the R Consortium how the “New R Community in Botswana Wants to Implement Data Into Local Businesses. In this new interview, Edson updated the R Consortium about the group’s growth and recent activities. The Botswana R User Group has attracted a global audience through its online events and actively collaborates with R User Groups in the region.\nThe Botswana R User Group is seeking speakers for their upcoming online events. If you are an R expert interested in sharing your experience with R users in Botswana, please contact Edson at botswanarusers@gmail.com\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nMy educational background is in finance. I pursued finance and investments for my master’s degree but also studied economics during my undergraduate years. Mathematics has been my strongest subject since primary school, and I’m passionate about it. This passion led me to develop an interest in Statistics and statistical software.\nIn the past, I mainly used SPSS, Stata, and EViews for my statistical analysis projects. Then, someone introduced me to data science. During my research on data science, I discovered that two popular programming languages are used for it. I installed Python for the first time, but I could not use it as I didn’t have a computer science background. So, I switched to R and started watching a few YouTube videos. From there, I continued to learn and improve my skills in R.\nR was my first language of choice for Data Science. Currently, I use both R and Python for my work.\nI am pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with Data Science from the University of Sunderland. Our different modules use R and Python, and knowing both languages is helping me in my studies.\nAs I was learning R around 2019 and beginning to follow several R Users on Twitter, I discovered that small R communities gathered together to learn and share knowledge about it. R Ladies Johannesburg in South Africa inspired me the most, as they held events more frequently during that time. I then became interested in starting an R User community in Botswana.\nIn February 2020, I reached out to Heather Turner, who was scheduled to visit Botswana and other Southern African countries to conduct Introduction to R workshops. During our conversation, Heather provided me with all the information needed to start a community. As a result, in March 2020, Botswana R Users was established during Heather Turner’s Introduction to R workshop.\nHow has your group been doing since we last talked?\nOur meetup group had about 100 members when we last talked to you. We now have almost 400 members. However, I have observed that people from different countries are joining us. We are now a global meetup group rather than a Botswana User group. This is because we mostly hold online meetups, which allow people from other countries to join.\nParticipants attending an online meetup hosted by Botswana R users in collaboration with Estwatini R Users and Bulawayo R\nWe are, however, still committed to growing the local community. We want to see more local participation in our meetup group. Last year, we collaborated with R Ladies Gaborone to organize an introduction to R workshop to increase our local membership. We are pleased to announce that this year, we plan to hold another workshop as a pre-conference event in the upcoming Botswana Deep Learning Indaba conference in July 2024. This workshop will help us to increase our local membership further and create more awareness about our group.\nParticipant at the Introduction to R Workshop held in collaboration between Botswana R users and R Ladies Gaborone\nWe value collaborations with our partner R User meetup groups in Southern Africa. In recent years, we have had regular meetups involving collaborative efforts with the Bulawayo R User Group from Zimbabwe, the Eswatini R User Group from Swaziland, and the Namibia R User Group from Namibia. We have established a routine of holding joint meetups almost every two months, depending on the availability of speakers. The idea is to grow our communities by increasing the frequency of activities.\nVebash Naidoo of RLadies Jozi presenting in an online meetup for Botswana R Users\nYou have a Meetup titled “GIS and Creating Dashboards in R. A case study of conflicts events in Kenya,” can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?\nI had an opportunity to attend a series of workshops and webinars organized by the United Nations for their Datathon. I realized the importance of GIS in advancing sustainable development. In January 2024, I invited Godwin Murithi, a GIS specialist, to present a topic on GIS. The topic was “GIS and Creating Dashboards in R. A case study of conflict events in Kenya.” We wanted to expose our members to the rising field of GIS and show them how the R language and various packages can help solve GIS problems. It was a fascinating topic for our participants, and they loved it.\nHow has the use of R evolved in the industry since we last talked?\nWe are observing an increasing acceptance of the R programming language, particularly in universities. Some universities have adopted R as their primary language for statistics and quantitative programs. This trend indicates academic institutions’ growing preference for open source programming languages.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nOrganizing is one of the most challenging tasks. To get speakers, I have primarily used Twitter (now called X) and LinkedIn to communicate with people who might want to speak at our meetup groups. Lately, there has been a problem with sending direct messages on Twitter. The reason is that Twitter has changed its messaging system. Now, to send a direct message, you need to be verified. I have been affected by the fact that my usual way of talking to people has been disrupted. Therefore, I have resorted to using LinkedIn to search for people interested in R and reach out to them. Sometimes, they are too busy or cancel, which can be challenging. However, I have been successful in finding potential speakers through these platforms.\nOccasionally, we use different video conferencing tools like Zoom and Google Meet. We usually rely on these two platforms. However, sometimes a speaker may prefer using Google Meet over Zoom, so we try to be flexible and accommodate their preferences.\nWe also use GitHub. We have our account, and if the speaker has their material on GitHub, they can share the link with us. Alternatively, they can provide us with the material directly, and we will upload it onto our own GitHub account for the community to access. Ultimately, it all depends on the speaker’s preference.\nPlease share about a project you are working on or have worked on using the R language. What is the goal/reason, result, or anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nOne of my recent school projects was to create a dashboard about UK imports and exports, which I completed towards the end of last year. I developed this project using Shiny and R packages such as Shiny Dashboard, ggplot2, and dplyr.\nI’m currently working on another project that is still in its early stages. The goal of this project is to identify areas in Botswana that require greater financial inclusion. I am currently gathering data and plan to utilize R and Python to apply geospatial techniques.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nI have observed that people find Quarto and GIS techniques interesting. The community is gaining increasing interest in these areas, and I foresee the increasing use of R in GIS applications."

    "text": "Guest blog contributed by Ning Leng, People and Product Leader, Roche-Genentech; Eric Nantz, Director, Eli Lilly and Company; Ben Straub, Principal Programmer, GSK; Sam Parmar, Statistical Data Scientist, Pfizer\nSupporting the science of drug development requires computational tools with careful implementations of core statistical functions and data structures. The R programming language, a general purpose language developed by statisticians that grows dynamically through the contributions of a worldwide community of developers, is a common choice for serious statistical work. However, managing new versions of the core R language and the hundreds of specialized libraries (called packages in R) necessary to support multiple development groups in a way that ensures the consistency, reproducibility, and reliability of results poses many practical challenges\nThe FDA, for example, requires that the software and tools supporting a clinical trial submission are capable of producing reproducible results for an extended period of time. This means submitting code based on a version of R that is sufficiently tested and stable yet new enough to support the critical R packages over the required FDA time horizon.\nSo, how is the R environment release managed across different healthcare organizations? We interviewed individuals from different pharma companies to learn their internal approaches to keep their R environment up-to-date and secure.\n\nRoche’s Scientific Computing Environment is container based, with clinical reporting done from managed qualified images being released twice per year – roughly timed to capture the last update to an R major version (April release) and a 6 month later update (September release). For each image, R packages undergo a mostly automated risk assessment to document package quality. Automated indicators of package quality include test coverage, thoroughness of documentation, test coverage of exported objects (using covtracer), and may be supplemented with package adoption measured using download counts, author reputation or other peripheral knowledge of the package’s history. Prior to internal publication, a representative sample of reverse dependencies are re-evaluated to safeguard against breaking changes. If the package meets our quality criteria it is published to a continuously updated repository of validated packages corresponding to the image’s R minor version (e.g. x.x). This allows flexibility for teams to roll forward to newer releases of packages within a managed release by moving their renv snapshot to a later date, easing the transition between bi-annual image releases. A generalized version of Roche’s automated process has been open sourced as ’theValidator’, and more details on the Roche process was shared within the R Validation case studies series.\nEli Lilly currently updates its qualified R environment only after a new major release of R is available and the corresponding release of Bioconductor (utilizing that version of R) is also available. In a new release, all packages currently installed from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories are refreshed to their latest versions at the time of the release. Once the new R version is deployed, all packages are frozen for that particular release to ensure stability and reproducibility. Lilly maintains multiple R versions for backward compatibility. Only packages available on CRAN or Bioconductor are permitted for installation in the central package library. Lilly uses a hybrid approach of automation and risk-based assessment when a new package is requested for installation. In the event that a new version of a package is necessary for a project (such as a new Shiny application), the users are encouraged to leverage the renv package created by Posit to create a project-based environment which will not impact the central package library. As technology evolves and the R language becomes more prominent in clinical data analysis, Lilly continues to assess the current and future possibilities of a robust clinical computing environment primed for innovation while adhering to the foundational principles of reproducibility and transparency.\nGSK releases “frozen R environments” for clinical reporting work on a 6-12 month cycle. The choice of R version is the latest stable release with at least one patch release of R, e.g. 4.3.1 rather than 4.3.0. As R itself is stable with decades of use, we prefer to focus on package assessment for building of our “frozen R environments.” Packages for this environment can be from external sources (CRAN, Bioconductor) or internally built at GSK, regardless of origin we assess the same way. We pay close attention to author qualification and institutional backing, types and breadth of testing, documentation and examples, and the practice of software development life cycle practices. Once a package is approved in this process it will be included in the frozen environment. Packages change over time, if substantial changes are implemented in the packages, then we re-assess with a focus on those changes for allowing up-versioning of the package in the frozen environment. These frozen environments ensure that clinical reporting can be easily reproduced if needed as all packages versions and the version of R used during the analysis are contained in the frozen environment.\nPfizer releases one new R version every year. We typically target R-x.y.1 releases to pick up patches – so we might consider this a “stable” release. The process of testing, documenting, and deploying R into validated containers is performed every 6 months, with a new release of R once per year, e.g. R-4.3.1, and an update to package set and package versions 6 months later (for the same R version). We take a snapshot date of CRAN to form the basis of our package set for the container build. We try to balance competing priorities of getting latest versions of packages and newest package releases, while maintaining a snapshot and version-controlled release to ensure reproducibility and stability.\n\nHere is what we have: four companies and four somewhat complex bespoke solutions. It seems likely that if we interviewed a hundred representatives from a hundred different companies we would get at least a hundred different solutions. It is also not difficult to imagine that multiple protocols for managing R and package versions imposed a fairly complex project management solution on the FDA as it simultaneously deals with submissions from multiple sponsors.\nIn the R Consortium’s R Submissions Work Group meeting we have been discussing whether there might be a simple solution for at least dealing with the R versioning problem that might serve as a de facto standard for the industry. One suggestion that has gained some traction is that sponsors use the previous minor and latest patched R version for a submission. For example, if R version 4.4.0 is currently available then it is suggested that a sponsor uses the latest patch version (4.3.z). If R version 4.5.0 becomes available, then it is suggested that a sponsor uses the latest patch version (4.4.z). This ensures that the minor version is stable and most likely available to all stakeholders. Of course, if a version change eliminates a security problem, that might be preferred. (Note that R versions are organized R x.y.z where, x is the major version, y is the minor version, and z is the patch version.)\nWe would love to hear what you think. Please, go to Issue number 117 on the GitHub repository of our working group and leave a comment."

    "text": "Jan Paul, Water Quality Lab Coordinator at Penobscot Nation, sampling in field\n\n\nIn a recent interview by the R Consortium, Angie Reed, Water Resources Planner for the Penobscot Indian Nation, shared her experience learning and using R in river conservation and helping preserve a whole way of life. Educated in New Hampshire and Colorado, Angie began her career with the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, later joining the Penobscot Indian Nation. Her discovery of R transformed her approach to environmental statistics, leading to the development of an interactive R Shiny application for community engagement.\npαnawάhpskewi (Penobscot people) derive their name from the pαnawάhpskewtəkʷ (Penobscot River), and their view of the Penobscot River as a relative guides all of the Water Resources Program’s efforts. This perspective is also reflected in the Penobscot Water Song, which thanks the water and expresses love and respect. Angie has been honored to:\n\nwork for the Water Resources Program,\ncontribute to the Tribal Exchange Network Group,\nengage young students in environmental stewardship and R coding, blending traditional views with modern technology for effective environmental protection and community involvement, and\nwork with Posit to develop the animated video about Penobscot Nation and show it at the opening of posit:conf 2024\n\nPlease tell us about your background and how you came to use R as part of your work on the Penobscot Indian Nation.\nI grew up in New Hampshire and completed my Bachelor of Science at the University of New Hampshire, followed by a Master of Science at Colorado State University. After spending some time out west, I returned to the Northeast for work. I began by joining the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in Houlton, Maine, right after finishing my graduate studies in 1998. Then, in 2004, I started working with the Penobscot Indian Nation. Currently, I work for both tribes, full-time with Penobscot and part-time with Maliseet.\nMy first encounter with R was during an environmental statistics class taught by a former USGS employee, Dennis Helsel during a class he taught for his business Practical Stats. He introduced us to a package in R called R Commander. Initially, I only used it for statistics, but soon, I realized there was much more to R. I began teaching myself how to use ggplot for graphing. I spent months searching and learning, often frustrated, but it paid off as I started creating more sophisticated graphs for our reports.\nWe often collaborate with staff from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Region One (New England, including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and 10 Tribal Nations). One of their staff, Valerie Bataille, introduced us to R Carpentries classes. She organized a free class for tribal staff in our region. Taking that class was enlightening; I realized there was so much more I could have learned earlier, making my journey easier. This experience was foundational for me, marking the transition from seeing R as an environmental statistics tool to recognizing its broader applications. It’s a bit cliché, but this journey typifies how many people discover and learn new skills in this field.\nThe Penobscot Nation views the Penobscot River as a relative or family. How does that make water management for the Penobscot River different from other water resource management?\nIf you watch The River is Our Relative, the video delves deeper into seeing the river from a relative, beautiful, and challenging perspective. This view fundamentally shifts how I perceive my work, imbuing it with a deeper meaning that transcends typical Western scientific approaches to river conservation. It’s a constant reminder that my job aligns with everything I believe in, reinforcing that there’s a profound reason behind my feelings.\nWorking with the Penobscot Nation and other tribal nations to protect their waters and ways of life is an honor and has revealed the challenges of conveying the differences in perspective to others. Often, attempts to bridge the gap get lost in translation. Many see their work as just a job, but for the Penobscot people, it’s an integral part of their identity. It’s not merely about accomplishing tasks; it’s about their entire way of life. The river provides sustenance, acts as a transportation route, and is a living relative to whom they have a responsibility.\nHow does using open source software allow better sharing of results with Penobscot Nation citizens?\nMy co-worker, Jan Paul, and I had the pleasure of attending and presentingat posit::conf 2023 and working with Posit staff to create an animated video that describes what we do and how opensource and Posit tools help us do it. It was so heart-warming to watch the video shown to all attendees at the start of conf, and was a great introduction to my shameless ask for help during my presentation and through a table where I offered a volunteer sign-up sheet/form, I was humbled by the number of generous offers and am already receiving some assistance on a project I’ve been eager to accomplish. Jasmine Kindness, One World Analytics, is helping me recreate a Tableau viz I made years ago as an interactive, map-based R Shiny tool.\n\nI find that people connect more with maps, especially when it comes to visualizing data that is geographically referenced. For instance, if there’s an issue in the water, people can see exactly where it is on the map. This is particularly relevant as people in this area are very familiar with the Penobscot River watershed. My aim is to create tools that are not only interactive but also intuitive, allowing users to zoom into familiar areas and understand what’s happening there.\nThis experience has really highlighted the value of the open source community. It’s not just about the tools; it’s also about the people and the generosity within this community. The Posit conference was a great reminder of this, andthe experience of working with someone so helpful and skilled has truly reinforced how amazing and generous the open source community is.\nHow has your use of R helped to achieve more stringent protections for the Penobscot River?\nBefore we started using open source tools, my team and I had been diligently working to centralize our data management system, which significantly improved our efficiency. A major shift occurred when we began using R and RStudio (currently Posit) to extract data from this system to create summaries. This has been particularly useful in a biennial process where the State of Maine requests data and proposals for upgrading water quality classifications.\nIn Maine, water bodies are classified into four major categories: AA, A, B, and C. If new data suggests that a water body, currently classified as a lower grade, could qualify for a higher classification, we can submit a proposal for this upgrade. In the past we have facilitated upgrades for hundreds of miles of streams, however it took much longer to compile the data. For the first time in 2018 we used R and RStudio to prepare a proposal to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to upgrade the last segment of the Penobscot River from C to B. Using open source tools, we were able to quickly summarize data and compile data into a format that could be used for this proposal, a task that previously took a significantly longer time. DEP accepted our proposal because our data clearly supported the upgrade. In 2019, the proposal was passed and we anticipate this process continuing to be easier in the future.\nYou are part of a larger network of tribal environmental professionals, working together to learn R and share data and insights. Can you share details about how that works?\n\n\n\nJan Paul, Water Quality Lab Coordinator at Penobscot Nation, sampling in field\n\n\nI’m involved in the Tribal Exchange Network Group (TXG), which is a national group of tribal environmental professionals like myself and is funded by a cooperative agreement with the Office of Information Management (OIM) at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We work in various fields, such as air, water, and fisheries, focusing on environmental protection. Our goal is to ensure that tribes are well-represented in EPA’s Exchange Network, and we also assist tribes individually with managing their data.\nSince attending a Carpentries class, I’ve been helping TXG organize and host many of them. We’ve held one every year since 2019, and we’re now moving towards more advanced topics. In addition to trainings, TXG provides a variety of activities and support, including small group discussions, 1-on-1 assistance and conferences. Although COVID-19 disrupted our schedule we are planning our next conferencefor this year.\nOur smaller, more conversational monthly data drop-in sessions always include the opportunity to have a breakout room to work on R. People can come with their R-related questions, or the host might prepare a demo.\nOur 1-on-1 tribal assistance hours allows Tribes tosign up for help with issues related to their specific data. I work with individuals on R code for various tasks, such as managing temperature sensor data or generating annual assessment reports in R Markdown format. This personalized assistance has significantly improved skill building and confidence among participants and are particularly effective as they use real data and often result in a tangible product, like a table or graph, which is exciting for participants. We’ve also seen great benefits, especially in terms of staff turnover. When staff members leave, the program still has well-documented code, making it easier for their successors to pick up where they left off. These one-on-one sessions.\nAdditionally, I’ve been involved in forming a Pacific Northwest Tribal coding group, which still doesn’t have an official name as it is only a few months old. It began from discussions with staff from the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) and staff from member Tribes. And I am thrilled to say we’ve already attracted many new members from staff of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC). This group is a direct offshoot of the TXG efforts with Marissa Pauling of NWIFC facilitating, and we’re excited about the learning opportunities it presents.\nOur work, including the tribal assistance hours, is funded through a grant that reimburses the Penobscot Nation for the time I spend on these activities. As we move forward with the coding group, planning to invite speakers and organize events, it’s clear there’s much to share with this audience, possibly in future blogs like this one. This work is all part of our broader effort to support tribes in their environmental data management endeavors. If anyone would like to offer their time toward these kinds of assistance, they can use the TXG google form to sign up.\nHow do you engage with young people?\nI am deeply committed to engaging the younger generation, especially the students at Penobscot Nation’s Indian Island school (pre-K through 8th grade). In our Water Resources Program at Penobscot Nation, we actively involve these students in our river conservation efforts. We see our role as not just their employees but as protectors of the river for their future.\n\n\n\nSampling for Bacteria\n\n\nOur approach includes hands-on activities like taking students to the river for bacteria monitoring. They participate in collecting samples and processing them in our lab, gaining practical experience in environmental monitoring. This hands-on learning is now being enhanced with the development of the R Shiny app I’m working on with Jasmine, to make data interpretation more interactive and engaging for the students.\nRecognizing their budding interest in technology, I’m also exploring the possibility of starting a mini R coding group at the school. With students already exposed to basic coding through MIT’s Scratch, advancing to R seems a promising and exciting step.\nBeyond the Penobscot Nation school, we’re extending our reach to local high schools like Orono Middle School. We recently involved eighth graders, including two Penobscot Nation citizens, in our bacteria monitoring project. This collaboration has motivated me to consider establishing an R coding group in these high schools, allowing our students continuous access to these learning opportunities.\n\n\n\nProcessing bacteria sample\n\n\nMy vision is to create a learning environment in local high schools where students can delve deeper into data analysis and coding. This initiative aims to extend our impact, ensuring students have continuous access to educational opportunities that merge environmental knowledge with tech skills and an appreciation of Penobscot people, culture and the work being done in our program.\nOver the years, witnessing the growth of students who participated in our programs has been immensely gratifying. . A particularly inspiring example is a young Penobscot woman, Shantel Neptune, who did an internship with us through the Wabanaki Youth in Science (WaYS) Program a few years back , then a data internship through TXG and is now a full-time employee in the Water Resources Program. Shantel is also now helping to teach another young Penobscot woman, Maddie Huerth, about data collection, management, analysis and visualization while she is our temporary employee. We’re planning sessions this winter to further enhance their R coding skills, a critical aspect of their professional development.\nIt’s essential to me that these women, along with others, receive comprehensive training. Our program’s success hinges on it being led by individuals who are not only skilled but who also embody Penobscot Nation’s values and traditions. Empowering young Penobscot citizens to lead these initiatives is not just a goal but a necessity. Their growth and development are vital to the continuity and integrity of our work, and I am committed to nurturing their skills and confidence. This endeavor is more than just education; it’s about preserving identity and ensuring our environmental efforts resonate with the Penobscot spirit and needs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium recently reconnected with Paul Stewart, founder of Moffitt Cancer Center Bio-Data Club in Tampa, Florida. Since the last update on January 6th, 2023, the Moffitt Cancer Center Bio-Data Club has hosted special guest Dr. Josh Starmer of StatQuest, and it has welcomed new co-organizers Rodrigo Carvajal, Nathan Van Bibber and Dr. Alex Soupir. The club has maintained its momentum with monthly meetings that have featured enriching discussions, educational talks, and practical tutorials.\nOne big change they have made this year is revamping their annual hackathon to broaden its scope and encourage greater participation from external academic institutions and industry partners. This expansion aims to enrich the event with diverse perspectives and innovative ideas, marking a significant step forward for the club and its contributions to bioinformatics and cancer research.\nWhat is new with Moffitt Cancer Center Bio-Data Club since last we spoke on Jan 6th, 2023?\nSomething new is that we hosted sessions on spatial data analysis. Our work at Moffitt often involves big molecular data, delving into patients’ tumor samples or blood to uncover insights about genes, proteins, and metabolites. This exploration aims to unravel the intricacies of cancer, paving the way for new treatments or early detection methods. Traditionally, we analyze patient tumors in bulk, meaning the entire sample is processed at once, and molecules of interest are extracted and profiled. However, the resulting data are just numbers in a matrix, and we lack the ability to define what part of the tumor the numbers are coming from. New spatial technologies have recently revolutionized our understanding of cancer and other diseases. We can now spatially resolve where genes, proteins, and metabolites come from in the tumor and neighboring cells. This advancement adds a crucial spatial dimension to our research, necessitating novel methods for data processing, quality control, and interpretation. Not to mention, these approaches generate some cool pictures. For example, here is an image from a spatial assay run at Moffitt for a project that I lead (funded by the Cancer Research Institute):\nI also want to touch on our hackathon. We’ve decided to broaden its scope this year, extending an open invitation to foster greater participation. Previously, attendance was mainly limited to the Bio-Data Club Meetup and our immediate connections at Moffitt. This year, we’re reaching out more actively to other academic institutions like the University of South Florida and industry partners. We are hoping to increase participation beyond last year’s 50 participants, and we are hoping to enrich the event with diverse perspectives and innovative ideas.\nPlease share about your background and your involvement in the R Community. What is your level of experience with the R language?\nI helped initiate the Bio-Data Club at Moffitt back in 2018. It began as an internal group but soon gained interest from beyond Moffitt, leading us to secure funding from the R Consortium. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to leading the club. In addition to this, I mentor trainees at Moffitt, including Moffitt research staff and students from the University of South Florida.\nI’m actively engaged in the local data science community; I’ve delivered lectures at the Tampa Bay R Users Group, the Tampa Bay Data Science Meetup, and, notably, at the 2023 D4CON Data Science Conference in Tampa, organized by Lander Analytics. (Editor’s note: Lander Analytics is an R Consortium member.) While my talks aren’t exclusively about the R programming language, they are intended to cater to the Tampa data science community.\nMy experience with R spans over a decade. As a Moffitt Cancer Center faculty member, I extensively leverage R in my research. I’d classify my proficiency as advanced, though I wouldn’t label myself an expert because I still learn new things about this great language daily.\nWhy do industry professionals come to your user group? What is the benefit of attending?\nBeing a part of Moffitt, located on the University of South Florida campus, our focus naturally gravitates toward biomedical academic research, and showcasing how data science operates within an academic research setting is beneficial. It offers a unique perspective and exposes attendees to cutting-edge techniques, like spatial omics analyses, which might not be part of the typical workload in a standard 9-to-5 job. However, our meetings must cater to a broad audience. Our meeting topics are applicable across many interests, one of which comes to mind was a presentation and demo by ComplexHeatmap author Dr. Zuguang Gu. We’re committed to broadening our discussions and introducing various topics and libraries relevant to R users and the broader data science community. My aim is to ensure that our meetings are inclusive, informative, and beneficial for everyone involved, irrespective of their field of work.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nThe realm of spatial omics and spatial data analysis, especially in the context of big biological data like genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, is rapidly evolving. It’s fascinating to see the development of numerous packages, including spatialGE and scSpatialSIM, which are pioneered right here at Moffitt. These tools are a game-changer because they allow individuals who aren’t necessarily experts in imaging or spatial data analysis to engage in and benefit from this research.\nAs a bioinformatics or biological data science researcher, my research focuses on mass spectrometry data, which involves comprehensive profiling of proteins, metabolites, and lipids in tumors or blood. This is a fairly specialized field, yet even here, there’s the Cardinal R package tailored for spatial analyses. This progress is exciting and indicative of a significant trend in our field. This trajectory is not just a fleeting moment but a substantial shift that will persist and evolve, shaping the future of bioinformatics.\nPlease share any additional details you would like included in the blog.\nIf you have a neat package or tool you would like to showcase, and please feel free to reach out at paul.stewart@moffitt.org. This is a great way for trainees or junior data scientists to get a presentation on their CV.\nMoffitt is consistently looking for talent on the academic research side and the operational side. For anyone who is interested, I’d recommend visiting the Moffitt website.\nI’m also excited to share that I’ll be presenting again at this year’s D4 conference in Tampa, scheduled for June 5th and 6th and hosted by Lander Analytics. Additionally, I want to shout out to the Tampa Bay Data Science Meetup and the Tampa Bay Data Engineering Meetup.\nOur annual hackathon is set for December 12th and 13th, 2024. Details about the hackathon are forthcoming, but for those eager to stay informed, the best approach is to join our Bio-Data Club Meetup. We consistently post all the relevant updates there, ensuring you’re well-informed and prepared for the event. Mark your calendars for December 12th and 13th – it’s shaping to be an enriching and exciting experience!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The R Consortium recently interviewed Myles Mitchell, co-organizer of the Leeds Data Science group, to discuss the local R community and the group’s recent activities. Myles highlighted the group’s efforts to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all participants. The group is dedicated to creating networking opportunities for students interested in pursuing a career in data science and sharing job openings.\nThe Leeds Data Science group is hosting an in-person event titled “Improving the Fidelity and Stability of Large Language Models” on the 23rd of July.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nI am a data scientist at Jumping Rivers, a data science consultancy. We collaborate with various companies on data-related projects, such as data storage, modeling, developing data visualization dashboards, and offering data science training. Initially, I had a background in Python, but I learned R while working at Jumping Rivers, where many of our staff are proficient in R, and much of our infrastructure is written in R.\nAt Jumping Rivers, we receive funding from the R Consortium. We organize the Leeds Data Science Meetups every two months and the North East Data Science Meetups every three months. Additionally, we hold annual conferences, such as Shiny in Production (October) and SatRdays London (April), which run once a year. I organize the North East and Leeds Data Science Meetups for Jumping Rivers.\nCan you share what the local R Community is like?\nI am located in Newcastle, in the northeast of England, where a large community is keenly interested in data science. Our community includes Newcastle University and Northumbria University students, many of whom are studying data science or statistics. There are also professionals from various industries looking for data science jobs. Our meetups are attended by prospective data scientists and students eager to network and learn more about the field.\nBoth universities teach R, and many industries in the area employ data science techniques, including Northumbrian Water and Nissan. These companies use data science to solve everyday problems, such as detecting water leaks and optimizing manufacturing processes.\nData science is relevant across almost all industries, and R, along with Python and other languages, is a crucial tool in solving data science problems. In the Northeast, consultancies like Jumping Rivers specialize in data science. In summary, we have a large community of students and industry professionals in the Northeast, and it’s a similar story in Leeds.\nYou have a Meetup on “Improving the Fidelity and Stability of Large Language Models”, can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?\nDuring our Meetup on “Improving the Fidelity and Stability of Large Language Models,” we will explore how to enhance software solutions with AI capabilities, focusing on improving the accuracy and reliability of these models. Drawing from real-world experiences, we will discuss successful strategies for development, tackle the challenge of model ‘hallucinations,’ and address other significant obstacles. This topic is essential as the AI sector continues to grow rapidly, and integrating AI effectively is crucial for developers to achieve robust performance and innovative functionality in their projects. The session is designed for developers of all skill levels interested in incorporating AI into their work, ensuring they can implement practical and effective methodologies for positive outcomes.\nRyan Mangan will be presenting this meetup. Ryan is a seasoned technologist with over 18 years of experience in cloud computing, AI, and virtualization. He founded Efficient Ether Ltd, a Microsoft startup specializing in AI, cloud optimization, and sustainability. Ryan is a recognized Microsoft MVP, VMware vExpert, and Chartered Fellow of the British Computer Society. He has authored several e-books and publications, including “Mastering Azure Virtual Desktop,” and is active in public speaking and blogging within the tech community.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?\nRegarding techniques, I’m currently reviewing how we organize our meetups. Our meetups are free to attend for all participants, and we aim to create a welcoming and accessible environment for everyone to network and meet like-minded individuals in the area. The meetups are held every two to three months on weekdays in the evenings, providing attendees with time to travel from their place of work to the venue. We offer refreshments at the start, including pizza and soft drinks, and we ensure that vegan, gluten-free, and halal options are included to cater to a wide range of dietary preferences.\nWe often run interactive workshops at the North East Data Science Meetups, including a recent meetup on the Apache Arrow interface for R, led by Nic Crane on July 18th. To make our workshops as inclusive as possible, we provide attendees with all necessary materials and dependencies via a cloud environment created using Posit Workbench. It allows participants without prior installation of RStudio IDE to contribute and interact with the workshop materials. Our goal is to make our workshops accessible to a broad audience, including those from non-R backgrounds. In general, we aim to create an event where attendees can participate without the burden of installing multiple packages or downloading data.\nMost attendees attend our meetups to network and meet industry professionals, especially students exploring post-graduation career opportunities. With this in mind, we always reserve a part of the meetup for advertising similar meetups and conferences in the area and job opportunities in data science. Many attendees regard these meetups as a regular source of news, so we try to provide a central hub of information and a place to enjoy high-quality live talks and workshops.\nThese are in-person meetups. We could attract more people if we recorded and live-streamed it on Zoom. However, managing a Zoom call and recording would create more work for the organizers, and an in-person event provides better networking opportunities than online. In saying that, we will continue to look at ways to make these accessible and appeal to a wide range of backgrounds, and we will always take feedback from the community seriously.\nWhat trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?\nIn the northeast and Leeds data science meetups, there is a significant interest in machine learning, training and deploying machine learning models, and productionizing these models (ML Ops). Attendees often expect talks on these topics and are particularly interested in chatGPT, generative AI, and other related issues. However, data science encompasses a broader range of areas, including visualizing data and creating dashboards, and we try to cover all of these areas in our talks and workshops. Despite our efforts, there is a clear trend toward machine learning-focused discussions, with many talk submissions focusing on ML Ops and deploying models on the cloud."

    "text": "Fernanda Kelly, founder and organizer of the R-Ladies Goiânia, recently talked to the R Consortium about the group’s efforts to provide a learning and networking platform to gender and ethnic minorities in the local R community. She discussed the group’s successful transition to virtual events, which has helped increase its visibility and reach.\n\n\n\nPlease share about your experience and involvement with the RUGS group.\nMy name is Fernanda Kelly, and I’m 28 years old. I graduated from the Federal University of Goiás with a degree in statistics. During my studies, I became familiar with the R programming language. However, it wasn’t until 2019 that I realized how underrepresented women and black people are in this field. This led me to establish a new R-Ladies chapter that same year to promote diversity and inclusion in the industry.\nI worked as a statistician for 4 years at Hospital Moinhos de Vento, where I was involved in the Pfizer Project that analyzed the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil. After that, I worked as a Data Scientist at Accenture Brasil. I hold a degree in Machine Learning and an MBA from the University of São Paulo. Recently, I completed a specialization in project management, and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Intelligent Systems and their applications in the Healthcare sector.\nI have incorporated the R language extensively in my work and studies. Its versatility in interacting with other languages and its diverse range of tools for creating reports, such as R Markdown and Quarto, provide users with multiple ways to develop high-quality models and reports. I have used R for various tasks, such as modeling, data processing, manipulation, and writing with blogdown and R Markdown. R’s constant updates and information dissemination about its features have increased my usage of the language even more.\nI haven’t been involved with the RUGS community lately, but I found out about the initiative on LinkedIn and thought, ‘Why not apply?’ Sometimes we hold ourselves back and don’t even consider applying for opportunities, but I applied this time and succeeded.\nOur group is a chapter of the global R-Ladies community that strives to promote awareness of R programming language among individuals belonging to minority genders. We cover a broad range of topics helping facilitate individuals entering the job market. Some topics we cover include public speaking, mentoring on how to fill out LinkedIn, and occasionally Excel. We believe R programming goes beyond just coding and that is why we emphasize the development of soft skills as well. We view the community as a trainer of future professionals. To date, we have held over 40 meetings, and this year we plan to offer over 20 workshops. These workshops will cover an array of diverse topics, but our primary goal is to showcase the functionalities of the R programming language in comparison to other programming languages like Python.\nI want to emphasize that the work I have accomplished for the R community since 2019 with R-Ladies Goiânia was not a solo endeavor. I have great admiration for the exceptional women I have walked alongside, and currently, I am fortunate to have Jennifer Lopes (a remarkable black woman) by my side since 2023, who has been helping me with R-Ladies Goiânia.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Goiânia?\n\n\n\nWhen I talk about community, I also refer to the city of Goiânia, located in the heart of Brazil, where the population is a mix of different ethnicities. The R community in Goiânia is huge, especially within the university. Many degree programs use R as their primary programming language. I fell in love with the power of the R during my undergraduate studies in statistics. However, during my master’s degree, I realized that there was a lack of representation for minority genders and ethnic groups. This led me to search for communities that catered to this audience. As a result, I discovered the R-Ladies community and founded the R-Ladies Goiânia chapter in mid-May 2019. Since then, the chapter has grown and reached out to many women, black people, and members of the LGBT community.\nR language is widely used in Brazil across various sectors, including health, agriculture, and financial institutions. The primary reason for its popularity is the vast range of packages it offers and the structured control offered by CRAN, which enhances the language’s credibility and security.\n\nDo you have an upcoming event planned? Can you share more about the topic covered? Why this topic?\nWe have an upcoming event planned which will be presented by Julia Helen, who lives in Rio de Janeiro. She is a statistician by profession and works as a data scientist at a large television station in Brazil. The meetup will cover the connection between R and Python. This event will take place on March 16th, and everyone is invited to attend. The primary focus of the meeting will be to teach R programmers how to use Python within RStudio effectively. By leveraging both languages, programmers will take advantage of their combined functionalities. The choice of this topic is because of the high demand among R programmers to learn about the use of Python and how to make both languages work seamlessly within RStudio.\nAny techniques you recommend using when planning or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive for people who may not be able to attend financial events in the future?\nR-Ladies Goiânia is present on diverse networks, but we recommend using GitHub to access our course material. We have complete control over the material available on GitHub, and it helps participants gain knowledge on the platform, which is often required by companies in Brazil. We are currently using Zoom through the Sympla platform, which is free and offers many control options over the event. The platform allows us to manage registration, accept the code of conduct, and send certificates to attendees.\nWe have hosted our meetings online since 2020, and it has worked well for our group. In our meetings we have people from various states in Brazil and, sometimes, we have people from other countries participating. This is incredible and this way we can reach more people, making the chapter decentralized. We have already reached 100 people watching the Introduction to R meetup. All of our events are recorded, and this gives people who could not attend the live event and people in career transition the opportunity to access the content. Currently, our YouTube channel has more than twenty videos.\nFor the future, we are planning more accessibility, but we know how poorly developed the accessibility of broadcasting platforms is. R-Ladies Goiânia aims to achieve real diversity in its meetings and has been working towards this with campaigns on Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter. We are seeking innovation and managed to open a mentoring program, which is a big step for the chapter and we are extremely happy.\nPlease share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?\nAs I mentioned before, my most recent project involved using the R programming language to analyze the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine in Brazil. The project was conducted in collaboration with Pfizer, a large pharmaceutical company, and the results have been published in an article titled “BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 against symptomatic Omicron infection following a mass vaccination campaign in southern Brazil: A prospective test-negative design study“. The code used for this project is available on my GitHub.\nWhat resources/techniques do/did you use? (Posit (RStudio), Github, Tidyverse, etc.)\nIn this project, we utilized a range of techniques. R Markdown was the most frequently used tool for generating reports in both HTML and PDF formats. Apart from the tidyverse package, we also employed a variety of packages for analyzing PDF data (such as pdftools), data analysis (including lme4 and sampling), and data tabulation (such as reactable, DT, and qwraps2). We utilized GitHub solely to host the codes for the published article.\n\nHow do I Join?\nR Consortium’s R User Group and Small Conference Support Program (RUGS) provides grants to help R groups organize, share information, and support each other worldwide. We have given grants over the past four years, encompassing over 68,000 members in 33 countries. We would like to include you!

    "text": "The R Consortium had a conversation with Anietie Edem Udokang, who is the founder and organizer of the Offa R Users Group (ORUG). He discussed the emerging local R community and the use of R for his research in time series analysis.\nThe Offa R Users Group has a Meetup coming up on March 26th, 2024, titled “Test for the Assumptions of Linear Regression Using R.” The group is also seeking individuals to serve as guest speakers for their online events.\nPlease share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.\nMy name is Anietie Edem Udokang, and I am a chief lecturer at the Federal Polytechnic Offa. I hold a Master of Science degree in Statistics. It was during my postgraduate studies that my supervisor introduced me to R, which was around 2012. Since then, I’ve been using R and have discovered that it’s far superior to some of the other software programs I had previously used.\nI have found that interacting with others and utilizing specific features, such as the ability to download applications, has been incredibly beneficial to my analysis work. These special packages have helped me greatly, and I believe it is important to attach relevant packages when organizing data. This experience has made me passionate about using R for data analysis.\nEver since I began using R, I have had the privilege of engaging with a diverse group of individuals, including data scientists and software users. These interactions have led me to the realization that to continue growing and learning, it would be beneficial to establish a user group within our community. Initially, we called it the “Fedpofa R Users Group,” but later changed the name to “Offa R Users Group.” We have been organizing meetings, providing training, and engaging in other activities to keep the community vibrant.\nCan you share what the R community is like in Offa?\nR is not limited to academic use, but it is also used in industry. The reason for this is that polytechnics act as a bridge between the industry and academic institutions. If the students have a good grasp of how to use R, it means that industry will be directly or indirectly affected. Consultants often visit our ORUG and ask for some analysis, which we provide using R. Additionally, students also use R for their projects.\nI use R for many of my publications. R has gained a lot of popularity, not only within our institution but also among sister institutions in the area. Some departments have even made R the only software that students are required to use for analysis.\nWhat industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?\nI am in the education sector, and I use R for my work in time series analysis, which is my area of specialization. I rely on TSA, tseries and other related time series packages to carry out my work. For example, I used R for Modeling the Residuals of Financial Time Series with Missing Values for Risk Measures, which was my MSc project. I have also used R in the Application of the Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average Model to Analyze and Forecast the Food Price Index (free registration required). Additionally, I used R in a paper titled “Volatility of Exchange Rates in Nigeria: An Investigation of Risk on Investment.” In another innovative project was Modelling Circular Time Series with Applications. These are just a few examples of the papers and research where I’ve personally used R.\nYou have a Meetup titled Test for the Assumptions of Linear Regression Using R, can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?\nSome authors use regression models without checking whether the assumptions hold or not. Instead of carrying out tests to confirm this, they assume that the model is valid if the assumptions are fulfilled. This topic aims to highlight the importance of carrying out such tests to ensure reliable and comprehensive results. Lack of adherence to the assumptions may lead to inaccurate conclusions. The focus will be on commonly used tests for normality, linearity, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity/homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity, with illustrative examples using R.\nI appreciate the R Consortium for their valuable RUGs grant assistance in 2022. With this grant, I could open two other user groups: the Ilorin R Users Group and the Kwara Environmental Statistics R Group. I also want to express my gratitude to the R Consortium for sponsoring my Meetup subscription and covering other minor expenses in 2022. The subscription is still ongoing, and I hope that we can continue our partnership to promote the use of R in our community.\nI would like to request for speakers to present at our R User Group. We are currently seeking speakers for our upcoming events and would be delighted to welcome speakers from all over the world to share their R-related knowledge with us."

    "text": "FAQ\n\nIs the R Consortium committed to R as an open-source project?\nDo I have to be an employee of a member of the R Consortium to contribute to infrastructure projects?\nWas the R community consulted about the projects considered by the R Consortium?\nWhat kinds of projects will the R Consortium undertake?\nHow are R Consortium projects selected and managed?\nAre the leaders of the R Consortium R users?\nCan I review the governance documents for the R Consortium?\nHow is the R Consortium governed?\nAre membership dues tax-deductible?\nCan an individual become a member of the R Consortium?\nWhy the focus on organizations rather than individuals?\nWhat is the relationship between the R Consortium and the Linux Foundation?\nWhat is the relationship between the R Consortium and the R Foundation?\nWho are the members of the R Consortium?\nWhy an R Consortium?\nDo I have to be an employee of a member of the R Consortium to contribute to infrastructure projects?\nCan I review the governance documents for the R Consortium?\nWhat wouldn’t the R Consortium do?\nWhat kinds of projects will the R Consortium undertake?\nWho will be involved?\n\n\n\nIs the R Consortium committed to R as an open-source project?\nDefinitely! The R Consortium’s explicit mission is to “advance the worldwide promotion of and support for the R open source language”, and all of its activities are in support of the Open Source R Project. It will support and promote the use of Open Source R in all contents, including in commercial and business settings.\nAs defined in its charter, the projects of the Infrastructure Steering Committee will focus on support of the user base, support of developers, and general advancement of Open Source R. In particular, a commercial fork of R isn’t compatible with that mission, and won’t be a project of the R Consortium.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to be an employee of a member of the R Consortium to contribute to infrastructure projects?\nNo. The R Consortium welcomes contributions of time, effort and ideas for all passionate users and developers of the R language.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWas the R community consulted about the projects considered by the R Consortium?\nYes. R Consortium projects are proposed by the community to the Infrastructure Steering Committee.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhat kinds of projects will the R Consortium undertake?\nThe R Consortium will coordinate and support projects that directly benefit stakeholders within the R user community. Here are some examples of the types of projects the R Consortium might undertake\n\nImproving documentation and tools.\nSponsoring and helping execute conferences and events.\nHelping to scale and build out R infrastructure.\nMaintaining an enhanced website focused on the R user community.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list. Anyone may propose a project to the Infrastructure Steering Committee, which selects and executes projects.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nHow are R Consortium projects selected and managed?\nThe technical projects undertaken by the R Consortium in support of the R Project and the R Community are overseen by the Infrastructure Steering Committee. The charter of the Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) describes its mission, which is to advance the worldwide promotion of and support for R, and to develop projects, technical and infrastructure collaboration initiatives, support specific initiatives related to R. The membership of the ISC is drawn from the Platinum Members, Silver Members and the R Foundation. As the ISC appoints top-level projects, it is expected that those project leads will join the ISC as voting members.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nAre the leaders of the R Consortium R users?\nThe Board Members (including the Chairperson) are appointed or elected by members (depending on the membership class). There is always one board member representing the R Foundation, to provide guidance to the R Consortium in its mission to support the R Project. The remaining Board members are drawn from the membership, and represent the organizations that have joined the R Consortium. All of the current board members have extensive R experience.\nThe members of the Infrastructure Steering Committee are appointed by the Platinum Members, Silver Members, and the R Foundation member, and includes representatives with significant technical experience, including R package developers, community leaders, and the individuals from the R Core Group.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nCan I review the governance documents for the R Consortium?\nYes! You can review the by-laws for the R Consortium, Inc. and the charter for the Infrastructure Steering Committee.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nHow is the R Consortium governed?\nThe R Consortium is governed by the R Consortium Board of Directors, which is made up of representatives determined by its members. (Members of the board are elected or appointed depending on membership levels; for details please see the by-laws.) The Board meets regularly to manage the business of the Consortium. Meetings are led by the Chairperson of the R Consortium, a rotating position held by a board member elected by the Board as a whole.\nThe technical projects undertaken by the R Consortium in support of the R Project and the R Community are overseen by the Infrastructure Steering Committee.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nAre membership dues tax-deductible?\nThe R Consortium is a US-based 501(c)6 non-profit organization. Dues are not tax-deductible as charitable donations by individuals, but under US IRS rules may be deductible as trade or business expenses.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nCan an individual become a member of the R Consortium?\nYes, individuals may support the R Consortium by joining as a non-voting associate member. You can also support the R project by contributing to the R Foundation directly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhy the focus on organizations rather than individuals?\nHundreds of companies around the world have invested heavily in R, by building systems on the R platform and by hiring thousands of R developers. The R Consortium provides a means for those companies to invest in the R Project directly, to collaborate on projects of mutual interest to support the R Community as a whole, and to support the ongoing success of the R Project.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between the R Consortium and the Linux Foundation?\nThe R Consortium is an independent organization, but as Collaborative Project of the Linux Foundation, the Linux Foundation provides operational support and guidance.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between the R Consortium and the R Foundation?\nThe R Foundation is the leader of the R Project and the custodian of the R source code and copyright. The R Foundation determines the definition and evolution of the R language.\nThe R Consortium, as an independent entity, exists to support the R Community and the R Project as a whole — and that includes providing support to the R Foundation. That’s why the R Foundation has a guaranteed seat on the Board and the Infrastructure Steering Committee, to represent the interests of the R Foundation and to propose projects to support R itself.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWho are the members of the R Consortium?\nMembers of the R Consortium include the following types of organizations: any association, partnership, organization, governmental agency, company, corporation, academic entity, or non-profit entity with an interest in supporting R. (Individuals may also join as associate members.) In addition, the R Foundation is automatically a member and always has a seat on the Board and the Infrastructure Steering Committee. You can see a current list of members here.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhy an R Consortium?\nThe R user community has experienced tremendous growth. With growth there is a greater need for cooperation and communication among R users and R stakeholders. R will continually benefit from improvements to its technical tools and resources. The mission of the R Consortium is to help with support and coordination of the important activities of the R Community, via projects selected and executed its Infrastructure Steering Committee.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to be an employee of a member of the R Consortium to contribute to infrastructure projects?\nNo! The R Consortium welcomes contributions of time, effort and ideas for all passionate users and developers of the R language. After formal meetings of the Infrastructure Steering Committee have begun (which we anticipate will occur soon), we will distribute information on how project ideas can be submitted to the Infrastructure Steering Committee.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nCan I review the governance documents for the R Consortium?\nYes! You can find copies of the by-laws for the R Consortium, Inc. and the charter for the infrastructure steering committee.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhat wouldn’t the R Consortium do?\nInterfere with the R language itself and its development.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWhat kinds of projects will the R Consortium undertake?\nThe R Consortium will coordinate and support projects that directly benefit stakeholders within the R user community, for example:\n\nImproving documentation and tools.\nSponsoring and helping execute conferences and events.\nHelping to scale and build out R infrastructure.\nMaintaining an enhanced website focused on the R user community.\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nWho is involved?\nR users and stakeholders as members of the consortium in addition to representatives from the R Foundation with operational support provided by The Linux Foundation.\n\nBack to Top"

Blogs should include the meta-narrative that “R is a fast-growing language for statistical computing and graphics” and “the R Consoritum supports the worldwide community of users, maintainers and developers of R software.”\nGuest posts must be vendor neutral, though it may mention vendors involved in specific deployment or adoption paths, or their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the community. It shouldn’t feel like an advertisement for your product, services or company though. Your post must be your content, but can be published elsewhere on the Internet with permission from that website. All content should have a byline (preferably by a company engineer) and be published under Creative Commons with Attribution, so you’re welcome to re-publish on your own blog.\nThe most interesting posts are those that teach or show how to do something in a way maybe others haven’t thought of. Good blog posts show hurdles that were encountered and explain how they were overcome (not that everything is rainbows and unicorns). When showing upstreaming of a patch fixing an issue for others, link back to the Github issue, so readers can follow along. We don’t avoid critical commentary or broad issues, but approach them with sensitivity, professionalism and tact in a way that is beneficial and positive for the community. It would be helpful to the R Consortium to discuss how to choose between different technologies and how to accommodate different legacy issues and cloud platforms.\nBe interesting and inspiring!"

One of its outputs, the CRAN package ddR, defines an idiomatic API that abstracts different distributed computing engines, such as DistributedR and potentially Spark and TensorFlow. The goal of the project is to enable R users to interact with familiar data structures and write code that is portable across distributed systems.

The ongoing “Improving DBI” project supports the specification of DBI, both in prose and as an automated test, and also the adaptation of the `RSQLite` package to these specs.

Profiling results can be analyzed with `summaryRprof()`, or visualized using the `profvis`, `aprof`, or `GUIProfiler` packages. However, the execution time of native code is only available in bulk, without detailed source information.

R-Ladies Global is a Top-Level Project of the ISC. R-Ladies Global guidance for starting and running a chapter, as well as overseeing chapters around the world, and for the rotating curator account, grew organically. The information is fragmented and exists in different formats: several Markdown and PDF Documents and wiki entries in a GitHub repository. This impedes the optimal finding of resources by those who need them, and also impedes contributions. This project aims to consolidate existing R-Ladies Global guidance into a well-structured and continuously deployed online book, with its source open on GitHub, as ( R ) Markdown documents woven together, and whose maintenance will be an R-Ladies major priority task.\nThe project will create a web based manuscript containing all the necessary information to understand what the R-Ladies organization is about, its structure and how to contribute to its mission. Information will be collated and organized leveraging the experience of R-Ladies organizers and volunteers that, over the past 4 years, contributed to the establishment and growth of one of the most active and successful communities in the data science realm. This book will be a crucial resource for R-Ladies and other organizations that are looking to consolidate or create their own guidance.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$6,000\nProposed by:\nEtienne Racine\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/r-spatial/sfdbi\nSummary:\nManipulating spatial data in R sometimes requires interaction with a spatial database: the data doesn’t fit in memory, or simply because this is where the data is. The `sf` package already supports the PostGIS spatial database, but this project will extend the compatibility and make it easier to integrate in the `dplyr` workflow (with `dbplyr`). We also want to make it easier to add support for new database backends. We’ll create a new `sfdbi` package to centralize the interface between `sf` and databases and remove dependencies in `sf`. If you want to contribute, or if you’d like to suggest a database, make sure to join the `sfdbi` repo.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$16,000\nProposed by:\nMaëlle Salmon\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/ropensci-books/http-testing\nSummary:\nMore and more R packages access resources on the web, and play crucial roles in workflows: data access and updates for CRM reports (Hubspot APIs), for scientific publications (scientific web APIs, Open Science Framework). Like for all other packages, appropriate unit testing can make them more robust. Their unit testing brings special challenges: dependence of tests on a good internet connection, testing in the absence of authentication secrets, etc. Having tests fail due to resources being down or slow, during development or on CRAN, means a time loss for everyone involved (slower development, messages from CRAN). Although many packages accessing remote resources are well tested, there is a lack of resources around best practices for HTTP testing in packages using httr, crul, or curl. The best guidance to date about HTTP testing for R packages to our knowledge is a forum entry that pre-dates the development of relatively new packages for HTTP testing that have now been released on CRAN: vcr and webmockr by Scott Chamberlain, httptest by Neal Richardson, presser by Gábor Csárdi. This project aims at curating a free, central reference for developers of R packages accessing web resources, to help them have a faster and more robust development. We shall develop an useful guidance, in the form of a open-source web-based book.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$35,000\nProposed by:\nOlga Vitek\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/kuwisdelu/matter\nSummary:\nThe project develops the MATTER 2.0 package for computing with larger-than-memory data in R. It extends the functionality of the existing MATTER package to any disk data format and in-memory layout. It also extends MATTER’s implementation with ALTREP to provide seamless interoperation with existing code, and various performance improvements critical for rapid prototyping of new statistical methods.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$10,000\nProposed by:\nBenedikt Gräler\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/BenGraeler/STDataAndAnalytics/\nSummary:\nMany data sets are recorded irregular in space and time. Movement of people driving the spread of an disease, or the distribution of current and future cases are per se irregular spatiotemporal data and only two of many examples. Being able to easily visualise, aggregate and model irregular spatiotemporal data will help to better understand and forecast underlying processes. Filling the gap for irregular spatiotemporal data and providing direct interaction with analytical tools will ease the analysis for researchers. We will develop the sftime package to a mature state so that the suite of modern spatial and spatiotemporal data representations in R includes irregular spatiotemporal data. After doing this, we will modify the geostatistical modelling package gstat and the spatial copula modelling package spcopula to support the new data representation classes of sf, stars and sftime.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$23,300\nProposed by:\nThibaut Jombart\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/2020-06-09-covid-challenge/\nSummary:\nThe RECON COVID-19 challenge aims to bring together the infectious disease modelling, epidemiology and R communities to improve analytics resources for the COVID-19 response via a website which will provide a platform to centralise, curate and update R development tasks relevant to the COVID-19 response. Similar to the Open Street Map Tasking Manager (tasks.hotosm.org), this platform will allow potential contributors to quickly identify outstanding tasks submitted by groups involved in the response to COVID-19 and ensure that developments follow the highest scientific and technical standards.\nWhile this project is aimed at leveraging R tools for helping to respond to COVID-19, we expect that it will lead to long-lasting developments of partnerships between the R and epidemiological communities, and that the resources developed will become key assets for supporting outbreak responses well beyond this pandemic.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$5,000\nProposed by:\nMathieu Basille\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/mablab/sftrack\nSummary:\nsftrack’ is a modern approach for tracking data in R. In response to the large diversity of ad-hoc solutions, in part outdated, we propose a generic and flexible approach that support all stages of movement studies (pre-processing, post-processing and analysis). ‘sftrack’ provides two central classes for tracking data (points) and movement data (steps), and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and plot them. Version 1.0 of ‘sftrack’ will be finalized and submitted to CRAN, and will already incorporate converters from/to classes of major existing tracking packages. We will further work with all tracking package developers willing to fully integrate the solution offered by ‘sftrack’ into their package data flow."

We also want to make it easier to add support for new database backends. We’ll create a new `sfdbi` package to centralize the interface between `sf` and databases and remove dependencies in `sf`. If you want to contribute, or if you’d like to suggest a database, make sure to join the `sfdbi` repo.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$16,000\nProposed by:\nMaëlle Salmon\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/ropensci-books/http-testing\nSummary:\nMore and more R packages access resources on the web, and play crucial roles in workflows: data access and updates for CRM reports (Hubspot APIs), for scientific publications (scientific web APIs, Open Science Framework). Like for all other packages, appropriate unit testing can make them more robust. Their unit testing brings special challenges: dependence of tests on a good internet connection, testing in the absence of authentication secrets, etc. Having tests fail due to resources being down or slow, during development or on CRAN, means a time loss for everyone involved (slower development, messages from CRAN). Although many packages accessing remote resources are well tested, there is a lack of resources around best practices for HTTP testing in packages using httr, crul, or curl. The best guidance to date about HTTP testing for R packages to our knowledge is a forum entry that pre-dates the development of relatively new packages for HTTP testing that have now been released on CRAN: vcr and webmockr by Scott Chamberlain, httptest by Neal Richardson, presser by Gábor Csárdi. This project aims at curating a free, central reference for developers of R packages accessing web resources, to help them have a faster and more robust development. We shall develop an useful guidance, in the form of a open-source web-based book.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$35,000\nProposed by:\nOlga Vitek\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/kuwisdelu/matter\nSummary:\nThe project develops the MATTER 2.0 package for computing with larger-than-memory data in R. It extends the functionality of the existing MATTER package to any disk data format and in-memory layout. It also extends MATTER’s implementation with ALTREP to provide seamless interoperation with existing code, and various performance improvements critical for rapid prototyping of new statistical methods.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$10,000\nProposed by:\nBenedikt Gräler\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/BenGraeler/STDataAndAnalytics/\nSummary:\nMany data sets are recorded irregular in space and time. Movement of people driving the spread of an disease, or the distribution of current and future cases are per se irregular spatiotemporal data and only two of many examples. Being able to easily visualise, aggregate and model irregular spatiotemporal data will help to better understand and forecast underlying processes. Filling the gap for irregular spatiotemporal data and providing direct interaction with analytical tools will ease the analysis for researchers. We will develop the sftime package to a mature state so that the suite of modern spatial and spatiotemporal data representations in R includes irregular spatiotemporal data. After doing this, we will modify the geostatistical modelling package gstat and the spatial copula modelling package spcopula to support the new data representation classes of sf, stars and sftime.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$23,300\nProposed by:\nThibaut Jombart\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/2020-06-09-covid-challenge/\nSummary:\nThe RECON COVID-19 challenge aims to bring together the infectious disease modelling, epidemiology and R communities to improve analytics resources for the COVID-19 response via a website which will provide a platform to centralise, curate and update R development tasks relevant to the COVID-19 response. Similar to the Open Street Map Tasking Manager (tasks.hotosm.org), this platform will allow potential contributors to quickly identify outstanding tasks submitted by groups involved in the response to COVID-19 and ensure that developments follow the highest scientific and technical standards.\nWhile this project is aimed at leveraging R tools for helping to respond to COVID-19, we expect that it will lead to long-lasting developments of partnerships between the R and epidemiological communities, and that the resources developed will become key assets for supporting outbreak responses well beyond this pandemic.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$5,000\nProposed by:\nMathieu Basille\nWebsite:\nhttps://github.com/mablab/sftrack\nSummary:\nsftrack’ is a modern approach for tracking data in R. In response to the large diversity of ad-hoc solutions, in part outdated, we propose a generic and flexible approach that support all stages of movement studies (pre-processing, post-processing and analysis). ‘sftrack’ provides two central classes for tracking data (points) and movement data (steps), and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and plot them. Version 1.0 of ‘sftrack’ will be finalized and submitted to CRAN, and will already incorporate converters from/to classes of major existing tracking packages. We will further work with all tracking package developers willing to fully integrate the solution offered by ‘sftrack’ into their package data flow."

For example, although htmlwidgets has proven itself to be a powerful framework for enabling interactive, JavaScript based data visualizations, data flow from R to Javascript runs on a one-way street.

It aims to provide modern, curated, and approachable environmental data samples from the US Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER) through the lterdatasampler R package. By offering datasets that save time for instructors, engage students with meaningful data, and foster discussions based on real-world questions.The package serves as a valuable resource for teaching introductory statistics and data science in R. The project seeks funding to expand the package to include data samples from all 28 LTER network sites, with the goal of modernizing course materials with real-world environmental datasets.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$20,000\nProposed by:\nLaura Sangalli\nSummary:\nFemr: There is a need for implementing finite element methods (FEM) in R to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are crucial mathematical tools used for modeling complex phenomena in various scientific and engineering fields. However, the absence of FEM implementations in R necessitates the reliance on external software, discouraging the statistical community from developing methods involving PDEs and hindering the learning of this essential mathematical tool. The goal of the project is to develop the femR package, which will provide a finite element basis for solving second-order linear elliptic PDEs on general two-dimensional spatial domains in R.\nThis package will complement the existing deSolve package and enable users to employ finite elements instead of finite differences for solving PDEs on more diverse spatial domains. The development process will include providing comprehensive examples and a final vignette to guide users in utilizing the package’s functionalities.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$5,000\nProposed by:\nNicholas Tierney\nSummary:\nThe proposal for “Continuing to Improve R’s Ability to Visualise and Explore Missing Values” addresses missing values in data analysis. Missing values are often dropped by default in data analysis in various stages. There is often not even a warning displayed to alert the user of missing values being dropped or discarded. This means values can be dropped without the user knowing, leading to issues such as potential bias, where missing values might be occurring in high numbers in particular groups.\nThe proposal for the ISC-funded project addressed this problem in four parts:\n\nPart one: Initial evaluation of additional missing data visualizations\nPart two: Implementation of missing data visualizations\nPart three: Will provide tutorials and workflows.\nPart four: Future extensions and beyond\n\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$2,000\nProposed by:\nThiyanga Talagala\nSummary:\nThe Dengue Data Hub project helps addresses data packages related to Dengue. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has spread fast throughout the world, primarily in urban and semi-urban regions. The goal of the Dengue Data Hub is to provide the research community with a unified dataset helpful for dengue research and reproducibility of research. The project proposes the creation of an R package for aggregating dengue data from several sources and the ability to share them in tidy format. Based on the proposal, there will also be tutorials and good documentation for using the “Dengue Data Hub” interface. This will motivate epidemiology researchers to utilize R to analyze their data."

The project seeks funding to expand the package to include data samples from all 28 LTER network sites, with the goal of modernizing course materials with real-world environmental datasets.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$20,000\nProposed by:\nLaura Sangalli\nSummary:\nFemr: There is a need for implementing finite element methods (FEM) in R to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are crucial mathematical tools used for modeling complex phenomena in various scientific and engineering fields. However, the absence of FEM implementations in R necessitates the reliance on external software, discouraging the statistical community from developing methods involving PDEs and hindering the learning of this essential mathematical tool. The goal of the project is to develop the femR package, which will provide a finite element basis for solving second-order linear elliptic PDEs on general two-dimensional spatial domains in R.\nThis package will complement the existing deSolve package and enable users to employ finite elements instead of finite differences for solving PDEs on more diverse spatial domains. The development process will include providing comprehensive examples and a final vignette to guide users in utilizing the package’s functionalities.\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$5,000\nProposed by:\nNicholas Tierney\nSummary:\nThe proposal for “Continuing to Improve R’s Ability to Visualise and Explore Missing Values” addresses missing values in data analysis. Missing values are often dropped by default in data analysis in various stages. There is often not even a warning displayed to alert the user of missing values being dropped or discarded. This means values can be dropped without the user knowing, leading to issues such as potential bias, where missing values might be occurring in high numbers in particular groups.\nThe proposal for the ISC-funded project addressed this problem in four parts:\n\nPart one: Initial evaluation of additional missing data visualizations\nPart two: Implementation of missing data visualizations\nPart three: Will provide tutorials and workflows.\nPart four: Future extensions and beyond\n\n\n\n\nFunded:\n$2,000\nProposed by:\nThiyanga Talagala\nSummary:\nThe Dengue Data Hub project helps addresses data packages related to Dengue. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has spread fast throughout the world, primarily in urban and semi-urban regions. The goal of the Dengue Data Hub is to provide the research community with a unified dataset helpful for dengue research and reproducibility of research. The project proposes the creation of an R package for aggregating dengue data from several sources and the ability to share them in tidy format. Based on the proposal, there will also be tutorials and good documentation for using the “Dengue Data Hub” interface. This will motivate epidemiology researchers to utilize R to analyze their data."
