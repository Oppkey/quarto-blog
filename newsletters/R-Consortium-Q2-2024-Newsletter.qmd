## Technical Projects and Working Groups

### ISC Projects

The Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) conducts two open grant cycles to evaluate proposals from the community for projects that the committee believes will contribute to the technical infrastructure of the R ecosystem. During the second grant cycle of 2023, the ISC funded the following seven projects with a total of $80,000:

- Translating R to Nepali
- Tooling for internationalization of R help pages
- RStats Mastodon Server
- Taking r-universe to the next level
- Causal Inference in a Box
- R Kafka Client
- Accessibility Enhancements for the R Journal

The first grant cycle for 2024 has recently closed, and the ISC is evaluating ten proposals which are collectively requesting more than $200,000. These proposals include translating a Public Health Model into R, adapting R-universe technology for deploying R packages, and upgrading or extending several key R packages. The ISC expects to notify the teams submitting successful proposals by May 1, 2024.

### R Consortium Working Groups

In this section, we will highlight the progress of selected R Consortium working groups. This month we look at the R Submissions working group and the Risk Assessment workstream of the R Validation hub, which have recently achieved significant milestones.

#### The R Submissions Working Group

With the active participation of the FDA, the R Consortium R Submissions working group is developing a series of Pilot or test submissions to uncover the challenges that must be overcome in making “all R” regulatory submissions straightforward, routine, and reproducible over a minimum six-year time horizon. Each Pilot submission builds on the previous pilot and includes additional steps. The objective of Pilot 3 is to extend the work done in the Pilot 2 study, which included wrapping a Shiny application into the submissions package, to build the AdaM data set from raw data. For each submission effort, the FDA review team recreates the study from the submission package, evaluates the correctness and reproducibility of the results, and documents discrepancies from previous pilot submission packages that they may observe.

In the most recent Pilot 3 submission, the FDA observed a discrepancy that was due to a difference in the coding of an imputation algorithm. The Pilot 3 statisticians used a subsetting algorithm that differed from the algorithm selected by the CDISC statisticians who built the ADaM data set used in Pilot 1 and Pilot 2. This was not a statistical error, but a failure to provide documentation at a sufficient level of detail for the FDA reviewers to make the appropriate adjustment. The episode illustrates the attention to detail required to achieve a smooth handoff to the FDA.

As the Pilot 3 team prepares their final submission, the Pilot 4 team is nearly ready with a submission package that will include the code required to unpack the package and have it deploy within a WebAssembly browser instance.

# The R Validation Hub Risk Metric Framework
<img src="images/riskmetricframework.png" alt="Our first newsletter cover" width="300"/>



The [riskmetric](#) R package implements a framework to quantify an R package’s “risk of use” by assessing a number of meaningful metrics designed to evaluate package development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability.

[riskassessment](#) is a shiny front-end for accessing the riskmetric framework. Features include the ability to manage reviewer privileges, explore package source files hands-on, automate decisions based on pre-set rules, and generate summary reports.

Recently, working with the R Consortium Rise Assessment team, ProCogia engineers deployed the reassessment application to a Posit Connect-powered implementation in the Azure cloud.

This new deployment should make it possible for anyone interested to experiment with the risk assessment approach to **“R package validation”**.

The following credentials enable you to test drive the application:

PWD: ProCon@123 </br>

# R Consortium Supports R User Groups Around the World!

The R Consortium R User Groups (RUGS) Program is the primary vehicle for the R Consortium to award Social Infrastructure Grants. Social Infrastructure includes meetings, events, conferences, and other activities to strengthen the R Community. Find out how you can support your local R User Group  here: [https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/r-user-group-support-program ](#)

Here are a few recent examples of great R User Groups around the world that we support:

# Building Extended R Packages to Improve R Infrastructure
A major goal of the R Consortium is to strengthen and improve the infrastructure supporting the R ecosystem. We seek to accomplish this by funding projects that will improve the technical infrastructure of R. Technical Infrastructure projects that have been funded include:

-  ~~[R-hub](#)~~, a centralized tool for checking R packages
- [Testing DBI](#) and improving key open source database backends
- Improvements in packages such as [mapview](#) and [sf](#)
- Improving Translations in R
- Ongoing infrastructural development for R on Windows and macOS
